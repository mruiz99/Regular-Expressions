Dear Friend,

I am Mr. Ben Suleman a custom officer and work as Assistant controller of the Customs and Excise department Of the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs stationed at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport, Ikeja, Lagos-Nigeria.

After the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked "Diplomatic Baggage". Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and discovered that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign currencies amounting to US$197,570,000.00(One Hundred and  Ninety-Seven Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars).

I declared only (5) five boxes to the government and withheld one (1) in my custody containing the sum of (US$30,000,000.00) Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being discovered during transportation process.Due to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his co-government officials stole from our government treasury amounting
to US$55 Billion Dollars (ref:ngrguardiannews.com) of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over US$3.Billion dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as "Precious Stones and Jewellry" in other that its
content will not be discovered. Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my colleagues in the operations team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a diplomatic arrangement which is the safest means. 

However as government officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign investment and the amount of money that can be found in our account
cannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your assistance to help collect and keep safely in your account this money.

Therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall definitely compensate you handsomely for the assistance. We can do this by instructing the Security Company here in Nigeria to
move the consignment to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through diplomatic means and the consignment will be termed as Precious Stones and Jewelleries" which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being transfered to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the destination country to take the delivery of the consignment. You will thereafter open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct remittance to your Country. 

This business is 100% risk free for you so please treat this matter with utmost confidentiality .If you indicate your interest to assist us please just e-mail me for more Explanation on how we plan to execute the transaction.

Expecting your response urgently.

Best regards,

Mr. Ben Suleman

ADDRESS:obong_715@epatra.com  

ATTENTION:PRESIDENT,CEO Sir/ Madam. 

This letter might surprise you because we have met
neither in person nor by correspondence. But I believe
it is one day that you got to know somebody either in
physical or through correspondence. 

I got your contact through discreet inquiry from the
chambers of commerce and industry of your country on
the net, you and your organization were revealed as
being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, one
has no doubt in your ability to handle a financialbusiness transaction. 

However, I am the first son of His Royal
majesty,Obong.D. Eleme , and the traditional Ruler of
Eleme Province in the oil producing area of River
State of Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in
respect of US$60,000,000.00 (Sixty Million United
State Dollars), which I inherited, from my latefather. 

This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my
father as compensation by the oil firms located in our
area as a result of oil presence on our land, which
hamper agriculture, which is our major source oflivelihood. 

Unfortunately my father died from protracted
diabetes.But before his death he called my attention
and informed me that he lodged some funds on a two
boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary
status. The lodgment security code number was also
revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a
reliable business partner abroad, that will assist me
in investing the money in a lucrative business as a
result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this is
the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move
this money from the security firm to any Country of
your choice for investment purpose. 

So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so
that the funds can be moved in your name and
particulars to any Country of your choice where it
will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had
intimated the security firm personnel that the
beneficiary of the box is his foreign partner whose
particulars will be forwarded to the firm when due. 

But I will guide you Accordingly. As soon as the funds
reach, I will then come over to meet you in person, so
that we can discuss physically on investment
potentials. Based on this assistance my Family and I
have unanimously decided to give you 30% of the total
money, 5% for Charity home, 10% for expenses, which
may arise during this transaction, Fax and phone bills
inclusive. The balance of 55% you will invest andmanaged for my Family. 

I hereby guarantee you that this is not government
money, it is not drug money and it is not money from
arms deal. Though you have to maintain high degree of
confidentiality on this matter. I will give more
details about the proceedings of this transaction as
soon as I receive your favorable reply. 

Please reply to my Email Address:obong_715@epatra.com
I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous
relationship between my family and your family. 

Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interested,
kindly inform me immediately so that I will look foranother contact. 

I am waiting for your quick response. 

Yours faithfully, 

Prince Obong Abbot

Dear sir, 
 
It is with a heart full of hope that I write to seek your help in respect of the context below. I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha the former first lady of the former Military Head of State of Nigeria General Sani Abacha whose sudden death occurred on 8th of June 1998 as a result of cardiac arrest (heart attack) while on the seat of power. 
I have no doubt about your capability and good-will to assist me in receiving into your custody (for safety) the sum of US$25 Million willed and deposited in my favour by my late husband in a security and deposit company. Though my contact to you for this assistance is not anchored on any personal ecommendation, I pray your understanding, good will and sincere assistance to respond to this message with honest intensions and concern. 
This money is currently deposited here with a security company as miscellaneous awaiting collection and according to the agreement entered into at the time of deposit between my late husband and the Security Company at the time of deposit; the collection centre is in Ghana. As it is legally required, the administration of my late husband's properties is under the authority of the family's lawyer Tony Musa. 
 
My Dear JK, since the demise of my husband, the present regime has been probing my late husband's wealth and properties, the London Newsweek of 13th march 2000 referred. The investigating team led by Enrico Monfrini, the lawyer acting on behalf of the Nigerian government has so far submitted their report and presently, some liquid cash and assets, movable and immovable, have been frozen and seized both locally here and internationally and my last hope is rested on the immediate security of this fund in your custody. Also, Johnnie Cochran, the lawyer who defended OJ Simpson, has been brought in by the Abacha entourage to help them retain the disputed funds. Fortunately, our family lawyer had secretly protected the "Personal will" of my husband from the notice of the investigators and have strictly advised that the willed money be urgently moved into an overseas account of Trusted Foreign family friend without delay. For security reasons and f!
urther advise,! no relations or fr! 
iends of ours should be used; as this is a measure of security. The government had earlier placed foreign travel embargo on all our family members and seized all known local and International outfits of our business empire. 
The situation has been so terrible that we are virtually living on the assistance of well-wishers. In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to respond to this "SOS" call to save my children and I from a hopeless future. 
I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort, immensely, which will be discussed between you, the Attorney and I. On your immediate response, the Attorney will travel to Ghana where both of you will meet, and thereafter proceed to the deposit company for the claims. 
The documentations include, most importantly, Power of Attorney and Certificate of Deposit amongst few others. These documents will be sent to you by Fax, as you would have to present them for proper claims. 
Please, be rest assured that this transaction is completely safe and legal but must be kept strictly to yourself even after the funds have been secured into our custody. This is so because any leakage of information could ruin the whole transaction. 
Please all contacts must be made through my lawyer on his email: tony_m@lawyer.com This has to be so as he has been mandated to handle this matter and I have fully briefed him (my Attorney) on my contact to you. Due to my present circumstance, I have handed everything over to him to co - ordinate and finalize with you and I will communicate you as at when necessary. Please for the safety of this transaction, reply stating your phone and fax numbers to enable them contact you directly without running the risk of mail interception. 
I look forward to your quick response. 
Best Wishes, 
Mrs. Maryam Abacha

Request for Urgent Business Relationship 
   
We are Top Officials of the Federal Government of

trapped in Nigeria. 
In order to commence this business we solicit your

subsequent purchase and inventory of the goods to be 
Imported and the investment abroad. 
   
The source of this fund is as follows: During the 
previous military regimes in our country, government 
officials set up companies and awarded themselves 
contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in 
various ministries. The new civilian government now 
setup  a contract review panel which i and my 
colleagues are members and we have identified a lot of 
inflated sum, due to our position  as civil servants 
and members of this panel, we cannot aquire this money 
in our names. 
I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust 
by my colleagues of the panel to look for an oversea 
partner into whose account the sum of us$31,000 000,00 
(thirty-one million united states dollars) will be 
Paid by telegraphic transfer. Hence we are writting 
you this letter. 

We have agreed to share the money thus: 
1.  70% for us (the officials) 
2.  20% for the foreign patner(you) 
3.  10% to be used in settling taxation and local and 
Foreign expenses. 

It is this 70% that we wish to commence the 
importation business and the investment abroad. Please 
note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope 
that the funds can arrive your account in latest 
ten(10) banking days from the date of reciept of the 
following information.A suitable company name and bank 
account(company or personel) into which the funds can 
be paid. 
   
The above information will enable us write letters 
of claim and job  description respectively. This way 
we will use your company's name to apply for payments 
and re-award the contract to your company name. 
   
We are looking foward to doing business with you and 
solicit your confidentiality  in this transaction. 
   
Please acknowledge reciept of this letter using this 
e-mail address. 
davidkuta2002@yahoo.com 
I await your urgent response.

search and found the security Company where I
confirmed that the consignment were deposited for safe
keeping in their securit vault in ghana.

The content were deposited as a family valuable, By
virtue of right as the son of my late father, the
security company has accepted to release the
consignment factually.

his consignment in your name as foreign partner to
claim this consignment. For your assistance,I am ready

CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD.
LAGOS, NIGERIA



ATTENTION:MADAM/SIR

I am MR.USMAN ABACHA , the Director of Operations
CHALLENGE SECURITIES LTD,LAGOS NIGERIA. Here in
NIGERIA Our firm is a security company of high repute
with years of outstanding service to the people of
Africa.

I have resolved to contact you through this medium
based on business proposal that will be of mutual
benefit to both of us. I got your particulars through
a consultant company base on my research for a
trustworthy and established person that understands
investment ethic for entering into a life time
profitable joint partnership investment and also
co-operation with confidence and trust that you will
keep the contents secret and divulged to any third
party.

To be explicit and straight to the point. Some time
early 1997, a reputable client of ours deposited a
consignment in our company's vault for safe keeping.
And since then our client has failed to come forward
to claim his consignment, which has accumulated a
considerable amount of money in demurrage.

Consequently, in our bide to contact this client to
redeem the demurrage which his consignment had
accumulated we discovered that our client was the
former president of the Federal Republic of Zaire, who
died of illness after he was de-throwed in the same
year the consignment was entrusted into our care.

Since the death of our client President Mobutou
Seseseko, none of his benefactors has come forward to
claim the consignment with us, which means that non of
his relatives or aids had any knowledge of this
consignment. Hence out of curiosity I decided to
secretly open the two boxes that our client deposited
in our vault. And to my surprise I discovered that the
two boxes that were registered as treasurer by our
client actually contained a considerable amount of
money in United States Dollars amounting to about
US$30 million Dollar. Since this development I have
been nursing plans secretly. I also found out from
enquiries and the foreign media that our late client
siphoned a lot of money from his country while he was
in office as head of state.

It is my conviction that the consignment in our vault
was part of the money that our client siphoned and now
that he is dead there is no race to this money in our
care.

I am now soliciting your noble assistance to assist me
in transferring this money out of nigeria to your
country for immediate investment with your assistance.
I have also decided that you will generously be
entitled to 30% of the total amount. Upon my receipt
of your reply confirming your willingness to assist me
of this transaction, I will immediately arrange and
transfer all the rights of ownership of this
consignment to your name to facilitate your easy
clearance and transfer of the complete funds to your
country.

you have nothing to worry about, as I will  be there
to assist you in anyway necessary with all proper
documentation.

This transaction is 100% risk free.

Please maintain absolute confidentiality on this
matter.


Thanks.

Yours faithfully.

MR. USMAN ABDUL

Dear Sir,
 
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so
informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and
unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR TEMI JOHNSON of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed
memory, may his soul rest in peace.
 
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my
colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately  decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through normal custom/airport screening and clearance.
Our inability to move this money out of Congo all
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed good friends (western countries) who suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the information We gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total confidentiality.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the modalities and what will be your share

FROM THE DESK OF DR.SAM JORDAN
THE MANAGER
Headquarter,
First Bank of Nigeria Plc.
Lagos, Nigeria.
Alternative E-mail: sam01jordan@yahoo.com
Sir,

Compliment of the day and how is life general with
you? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and
crave your indulgence to make this project request for
a joint business transaction which I hope will not
come to you as a surprise, hence I plead for
your pardon.

I am Dr.Sam Jordan, the  Manager of headquarter
First Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and
confidentialbusiness proposal for you. 

On June 6, 1998, an Italian oil
consultant/contractor with via National Petroleum
cooperation (NNPC) Mr. Paul Bush made a numbered time
(fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued at
US$43.7,000.00 in my branch.

On maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
forwarded address but got no reply after months we
send a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum
Corporation) that Mr. Paul Bush died from an
automobile accident. On further investigation, it was
clear  that he died without making a will. All
attempts by the Australian to trace his next of
kin were fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr. Paul Bush did not declare any next of kin or
relations in all his official documents including his
deposit document in my bank. The total sum
US$43.7,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant
acct.
No one will ever come forward to claim it. According
to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money
will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
Government. If the account owner is certified death
and nobody comes forward to claim it.

This is the situation , and my proposal is that I am
looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the
beneficiary/next of kin. This is simple. All you have
to do is to immediately send me the details of a bank
account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the
proper money transfer document. The money will then be
transferred into the account for us to share in the
ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining
10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with
here and there.

There is no risk involved. I am using my position and
connection in the bank here to do all the document
work for the transaction. We shall employ the services
of an attorney to draft the will and obtain all
necessary documents and letter of administration in
your fovour for the transfer. This transaction is risk
free guaranteed. If you are interested, please reply
immediately confidentiality and be rest assured that
this transaction could be most profitable for both of
us. Please do not expose this deal if you are not
interested because if you do, it will take me out
of seat.Please expenses is involve in this
business,phone/fax number,and your bank particulars.

I am awaiting your urgent reply.

Best regards,

Dr.Sam Jordan.

/ boxes and labelled as personal belongings and as such
the security company does not know the true content of
the boxes.This money was originally meant to be used
for his political campaign. Because I was his family
Attorney as such he confided in me with the
relevant document papers relating to this deposit
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement
with an offshore Security Company to move this money as
a consignment through diplomatic means to their
offshore affiliated office where you will be required
to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide
beneficiary of the consignment. You should know that
this business is safety and 100% risk-free as it
does not involve drug money or Terrorist fund.

From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!
d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!
e's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

Dear Sir,

A Very Good day to you   

I am Mrs Mariam Abacha. I got your contact from a
close Associate of mine who works with the Nigerian
Chamber of Commerce and Industry  who visited your
country for an International Trade Fair upon my quest
for a trusted and reliable foreign businessman or
company. 
He however gave me the assurance that you can be
trusted to handle a transaction of this magnitude.
Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani
Abacha the late Former Head of State of Nigeria in
1998, I have been thrown into a state of utter
confusion, frustration and hopelessness 
by the present civilian administration, I have been
subjected to physical and psychological torture by the
security agents in the country. 
As a widow that is so traumatized, I have lost
confidence with anybody within the country. You must
have heard over the media reports and the internet on
the recovery of various huge sums of money deposited
by my husband in different security firms abroad, some
companies willingly give up their secrets and
disclosed our money confidently lodged there or many
outright blackmail. In fact the total sum discovered
by
 the Government so far is in the tune of $700. Million
dollars. And they are not relenting to make me poor
for life. I will give you more information  as to this
regard as soon as you reply. I repose great confidence
in you hence my approach to you due to security
network placed on my day to day  affairs I cannot
afford to visit the embassy so that is why I decided
to contact you and I hope you will not betray my
confidence in you. I have deposited  the sum of US$35
million dollars with a security firm abroad whose name
is withheld for now until we open communication. I
shall be grateful if you could receive this fund into
your account for safekeeping. This arrangement is
known to you and my family lawyer who shall deal
directly with you as I am still under house arrest. I
am seriously considering to settle down abroad as soon
as this fund get into your account so that I can start
all over again if only you wish, but if it is
possible, 
just help me in diverting this funds into your bank
account which will accrue you 20% of this fund. Please
honesty is the watchword in this transaction. And
should you accept my terms, kindly send me an email
signifying your interest to my email box as this is
only safe for me now so that we can commence
 communication immediately. And upon receipt of your
message of interest, I shall give you a more detailed

 Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am DR.ANAYO AWKA , a Manager at the Union Bank Nigeria PLC, Lagos. I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum confidence. A foreigner, Late Engineer William Adams, an oil Merchant /contractor with the federal Government of Nigeria, until his death three years ago in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at the Union Bank PLC ,Lagos, and had a closing balance of USD$22.2M (Twenty-Two Million, Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)
which the bank now unquestionably expects to be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war collage here in Nigeria.

 Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any of late Engr. William Adams's next of kin (he had no known wife and children) that the management under the influence of our chairman, board of directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an arrangement for the fund to be declared "UNCLIAMABLE " and then be subsequently donated to the trust fund for Arms and Ammunition, which will further enhance the
course of war in Africa and the world in general. In order to avert this negative development, myself and some of my trusted colleagues in the bank now seek for your permission to have you stand as late Engr.WILLIAMS ADAMSs next of kin so that the fund, USD$22.2M, would be subsequently transferred and paid into your bank account as the

Your share would be 30% of the total amoun!t.! 10% has been set aside for expenses, while the rest would befor myself and my colleagues for purposes in your country.

The Director,



            SEEKING FOR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE 
              (TRANSFER OF US$15.5MILLION)

It is my pleasure to request your assistance on this business proposition which if pursued to its conclusion ,will be of immense benefit to both of us. This request may seem strange but I will crave your indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is Col. Victor Aloma of the Democratic Republic of Congo I am one of close aids to the formal president of Congo Democratic LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, may his soul rest in peace.

For the military of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebles in my country, I was instructed by him (late president Kabila) to go to the Europe to purchase ARMS
AND AMMUNIATION worth us$15.5(fifteen million Five Hundred Thousand us Dollars) to fight the reble groups. But when it became ap! parent  that president
Kabila has been killed in a bloody shoot out by one of his aids. I immediately decided to divert the fund ( US$15.5) into  a private security company for safe
keeping. The money is presently in Holland (The Netherlands) where I am currently in exile  after the death of president Kabila.

I need a reliable and trust worthy foreign partner/national who can assist me to clear and move this money as the beneficiary from the security company.

Though we have not seen nor met each other, but I would want this transaction to be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks, this money in question is state fund as it is a deal between you and I, hence the need for secrecy considering the security implications.


Thus, if you are willing to assist me to move this fund out of the Netherlands, you can contact  me onthe above email addres to enable us discuss more about the deal and what  your percentage will be for assisting me.

Please note that you will be required to make a brief trip to the Netherlands for inspection of the fund. I also intend to visit your country soonest in order to inquire areas of possible business investment.

I shall be sincerely glad if my request is rendered.

Kindest  Regards,

COL. Victor Aloma

DEAR RESPECTFUL,
I BEG TO SOLICIT FOR YOUR URGENT AND MAXIMUM
ASSISTANCE

THIS MAIL, I KNOW THIS MAIL MAY EMBARRASS YOU OR SURPRISE YOU BY EMBARRASSMENT, I MEAN COMING FROM SOMEBODY YOU NEVER KNOW OR MET BEFORE, EVEN COMING FROM A COUNTRY PERHAPS YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW (GHANA) NOTED FOR DISHONEST AND FRUADULET PRACTICES. WELL, THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE SCAM LETTERS FROM (GHANA OR OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES, BUT FROM A FAMILY OF WHO ARE IN DISTRESS AND REQUIRE YOUR ASSISTANCE.LET ME START BY INTRODUCING MYSELF PROPERLY TO YOU.

 LET ME ATART BY INTRODUCING MYSELF PROPERLY TO YOU, I AM MR. JAMES NGOLA, THE FIRST SON OF BRIDGR. GEN.
THEOPHILUS NGOLA (LATE). FORMER CHIEF OF DEFENCE STAFF: NATIONAL REPUBLIC OF LIBERIA. BRIEFLY: MY FATHER, BRIDG. GEN. T. NGOLA BEFORE HIS DEATH DIVERTED THIS FUND (US$25M) TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS. MEANT FOR PURCHASE OF AMMUNATION FOR MY COUNTRY "LIBERIA" DURING THE PERIOD OF THEETHNIC CIVIL WAR BETWEEN MY COUNTRY AND GUINEA REPUBLIC. AND NOW, THE WAR IS OVER BY THE INTERVENTION OF "ECOMOG"FORCES. 


FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE WAR ENDED, THE RADIO NATIONAL OF LIBERIA WENT ON AIR, ON A WILD BROADCAST, UNCINGAN UNSUCCESSFUL "COUPD'TAT" IN MY COUNTRY, ATTEPTED TO OVERTROW THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN MY COUNTRY HEADED BY "PRESIDENT CHARLES TAYLOR". THIS BROADCAST CONTINUED TO ANNOUNCE THE NAMES OF THOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE ATTEMPT. BUT UNKNOWINGLY TO ME, MY FATHER WAS INCLUDED AMOUNG THESE GROUP OF MEN ARRESTED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS PLOT AS THE "MASTERMINDER" AND THE "FINANCIER" OF THIS UNDEMOCRATIC ACT. ALTHOUGH HE WAS EXECUTED ALONG SIDE WITH OTHERS. (MAY THEIR SOULS REST IN PERFECT PEACE)

TWO WEEKS AFTER THEIR EXECUTION THE GOVERNMENT OF LIBERIA STIL WENT FURTHER TO PASS JURGEMENT TO CONFISTICATE MY FATHER'S ASSETS AND ALSO TO FREEZE HIS ACCOUNTS. SO WHEN THIS NEWS REACHED ME, I HURRIEDLY GATHERED SOME VALUABLES IN OUR FAMILY VILLA   AND ESCAPED TO (ACCRA), CAPITAL OF GHANA FOR SAFETY, WHILE MY MOTHER AND MY BROTHERS, SISTERS ARE NOW IN COTE D'IVOIRE AS REFUGEES. THIS FILE, WHICH CONTAINING DOCUMENTS OF A CONSIGNMENT (1 METALIC TRUNK BOX) DEPOSITED BY MY LATE FATHER IN ONE OF THE PRIVATE SECURITY COMPANIES, WAS AMOUNG THE VALUBLE THINGS I ESCAPED WITH TO GHANA. HONESTLY SPEAKING, IN THIS"BOX" IS THE SUM OF THIS FUND (US$25 M.) TWENTY FIVE MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS ONLY
DIVERTED BY MY LATE FATHER. HE REGISTERED THIS CONSIGNMENT (BOX) WITH SECURITY COMPANY AS TO CONTAIN (AFRICA ARTS WORK), BUT THERE IS A CLAUSE IN THE DEPOSIT AGREEMENT WITH THE COMPANY THAT SAYS ONLY HIS FOREIGN PARTNER WILL BE ALLOWED TO COLLECT THE CONSIGNMENT ON HIS BEHALF HENCE HE NEVER WANTED TO BE TRACED WITH THE AMOUNT AS A POPULAR PERSON.




IT IS ON THIS NOTE THAT I AM CONTACTING YOU TO FAITHFULLY AND CONFIDENTIALY ASSIST ME TO "FRONT" AS MY LATE FATHER FOREIGN BUSINESS PARTNER IN ORDER TO NECCESITATE AND FACILITATE THE CLAIM OF THIS CONSIGNMENT FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY. AND THE FUND ALSO BE TRANSFERED
INTO YOUR PRIVATE FOREIGN BANK ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENT PERHAPS IN YOUR COUNTRY FOR I CANNOT INVEST HERE DUE TO ITS NEARNESS.

ONCE AGAIN, I AM PRESENTLY LIVING IN GHANA ALSO AS A REFUGEE TOO (ASYLUM SEEKER) FOR THE SAKE OF MY LIFE. BE INFORMED, THAT THE FINANCIAL LAW OF GHANA DOES NOT ALLOW A REFUGEE TO OPERATE AN ACCOUNT NOR INCORPORATE A COMPANY. WITH THIS, COUPLED WITH THE WAY IN WHICH THE MONEY WAS ACQUIRED, AND I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO KNOW ABOUT THIS DEVELOPMENT THAT IS WHY I DECIDED NOT TO INVEST IN ANYWHERE IN AFRICA OR LIBERIA NOR EVEN GHANA WHERE I AM CURRENTLY RESIDING AS A REFUGEE AND THAT IS WHY I'M SOLICITING FOR YOUR SUPPORT.




IF YOU AGREE TO ASSIST US, I WILL COMPENSATE YOU WITH 15% OF THE TOTAL FUND AFTER THIS CONSIGNMENT IS CLEARED AND THE MONEY TRANSFERED INTO YOUR BANK ACCOUNT.

MOST IMPORTANT: PROMISE ME TO KEEP THIS TRANSACTION
CONFIDETIAL & SECRET BECAUSE THIS FUND IS THE ONLY HOPE OF 
MY FAMILY.

FINALLY, CONSIDER THIS PROPOSAL AND GET BACK TO ME

Dear Sir, 

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

I am Mr George Mboro , a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me.

I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction. Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars (US$18,500,000.00) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

This amount (US$18.5m) represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you. I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 30% of the US$18.5 million, 60% for us and 10% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hind!
rance to the successful execution of this transaction.

 I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above tel/fax number ,or my email address:mboro@accountant.com whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me contact other another Foreign partner with recommendation to carry out this deal. I want to assure you that myself and my partners are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and Please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter; because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business. 

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. I am available to entertain any questions concerning the clarity of this transaction.

 Yours faithfully,

Mr  George  Mboro

I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and profitable Business proposal, though I don't know you neither have I seen you before but my confidence was reposed on you when the Chief Executive of Lagos State chamber of Commerce and Industry handed me your contact for a confidential business. I am a Staff of United Bank
for Africa (UBA),Ilupeju branch, Lagos Nigeria.

The intended business is thus; we had a customer, a Foreigner (a Turkish) resident in Nigeria, he was a Contractor with one of the Government Parastatals. He has in his Account in my branch the sum of US$21.5 Million (Twenty One Million Five Hundred ThousandU.S.Dollars).Unfortunately, the man died four years ago until today non-of his next of kin has come forward to claim the money. Having noticed this, I in collaboration with two other top Officials of the bank we have covered up the account all this while. Now we want you (being a foreigner) to be fronted as one of his next of kin and forward your account and other relevant documents to be advised to you by us to attest to the Claim. We will use our positions to get all internal documentations to back up the claims .The whole procedures will last only ten working days to get the Fund retrieved successfully Without trace even in future.

Your response is only what we are waiting for as we have arranged all necessary things. As soon as this message comes to you kindly get back to me indicating your interest ,Then I will furnish you with the whole procedures to ensure that the deal is successfully Concluded. 

For your assistance we have agreed to give you thirty percent (30%) of the Total sum at the end of the transaction. It is risk free and a mega fortune. All correspondence towards this transaction will be through the e-mail addresses, Telephone and Fax, until the end of the
transaction when we will meet for the sharing of the money based on this agreed percentage.

Please reply urgently by e-mail, fax or call me on my private telephone numbers as stated above.

I await your earliest response.

Thanks, 

Yours Sincerely

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL 
RE: TRANSFER OF US$21.5 MILLION (TWENTY ONE MILLION, 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ONLY). 

I know this email will reach you as a surprise, but need not to worry 
as we are using the only secured and confidential medium available to 
seek for foreign assistance/partnership in a business transaction 
which is of mutual benefit. 

I am a member of the Federal Government of Nigeria Contract Award and 
Monitoring Committee in the Nigeria National Petroleum 
Corporatio(NNPC). Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign 
firm in NNPC by my Committee. This contract was over invoiced to the 
tune of US$21.5M. U.S. Dollars. This was done deliberately. The 
over-invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the 
project. We now want to transfer this money which is in a suspense 
Account with NNPC into any Overseas Account which we expect you to 
provide for us. 

SHARE: - 
For providing the account where we shall remit the money into, you 
will be entitled to 30% of the money,60% will be for me andmy 
partners while 10% has been mapped out from the total sum to cover 
any expenses that maybe incurred by us during the course of this 
transfer,both locally and international expenses. 
I would require the following: - 

. Your company's name,address,telephone and fax numbers. 
The above information would be used to make formal applications as a 
matter of procedure for the release of the money and onward transfer 
to your account. 
It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects 
of this nature described here. The assumption is that your company 
won the major contract and subcontracted it out to other companies. 
More often than not,big trading companies or firms of unrelated 
fields win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized firms 
for execution of such contracts. 

We have strong reliable connections and contacts at the Central Bank 
of Nigeria, as well as the Federal Ministry of Finance and we have no 
doubt that all the money will be released and transferred if we get 
the necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal. 
Therefore,when the business is successfully concluded we shall 
through our same connections withdraw all documents used from all the 
concerned Government Ministries for 100% security. 

We are ordinary civil servants and we will not want to miss this once 
in a lifetime opportunity to get rich. We want this money to be 
transferred to the overseas Accounts for us, before the present 
Democratic Government start Auditing all Federal Government owned 
Parastatals. 

Please contact me immediately through my telephone number whether or 
not you are interested in this deal.If you are not,it will enable me 
scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal. Butwhere 
you are interested,send the required documents aforementioned herein 
through my above telephone number,or 
email:edema_ma@mauimail.com,because time is of the essence in this 
business. 
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation. 

Yours faithfully, 
Edema Martins.

 From;Mr.Michael Kamah and Family,
          Johannesburg,South Africa.

My Dear ,

Good day.This very confidential request should come as a surprise to you.But it is because of the nature of what is happening to me and my family urged me to contact you, and I quite understand that this is not the best way to contact you because of the nature of my request and the attention it requires.I got your contact information from your country's information directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing some family fortunes.

My name is Mr.Michael Kamah, the second son of Mr.Smith  Kamah, of Beitbridge Zimbabwe.At the height of the present political crises in our country,in which the white farmers in our country are being slained and ripped off their belongings by the supporters of our president,Mr.Robert G.Mugabe,in their efforts to reclaim all the white owned farms in our country,my father and my elder brother were brutally slained to a painful death on the 13th of february,2002, in their struggle to protect some white farmers who ran to take refuge in our house.My father,during his life on earth was a prominent business man who trades on diamond and gold from some foreign countries .He publicly opposes the crude policies and crime against humanity on the white farmers by Mr.Robert Mugabe and his followers,which they enforced media law restrictions to protect their wicked acts.That not being enough,the president and his followers after winning the last undemocratic elections decided to block an!
d confiscate all accounts and assets of our black indigenes[that included my fathers assets and accounts] who oppose his policies and render support to these white farmers,along with the assets of these white farmers themselves,that are being presently confiscated.I therefore decided to move my mother and younger sister to the Republic of South Africa,where we presently live without anything and without any source of livelyhood.

During my fathers life on earth,he had deposited the sum of Seven Million and Four Hundred Thousand United States Dollars[$7.400.000.00],in a trunk box with a Finance and Security Company in the Republic of Togo for a cash and carry Diamond and Gold business with some foreign business customers, awaiting instructions to be moved to its destination,which he never completed before he met his untimely death on that faithful day.In view of this and as the only surviving son of my father,and with the present clamp down,killing and confiscation of his assets as one of those who render support to the white farmers in our country,I therefore humbly wish to inform you of my intentions to use your name and adress in making sure that this fund is lifted out of Africa finally,to the Europe office of the finance company and also seek for your honest and trustworthy assistance to help me clear and accommodate this money over there before it is dictated out and blocked by the present Mugab!
e's regime.My mother is presently with the valid document covering this deposit.

Now this is what I actually want you to do for me;

1. I want you to be presented to the Finance and Security company as the person I contacted to assist my family for this purpose, with whose name and adress myself and my mother will forward to them their office in the Republic of Togo as the person that will clear this money when they lift it out to their europe office.
2. To finally assist me in accommodating and managing this money in any lucrative business in your country for at least three years. 

Please,I hope you will grant and view this very request with favour and much understanding of our situation now,and will be a very honest and reliable person to deal with.And also bearing in mind the confidential nature of this my request,I emphasize please that you keep every bit of it to yourself so as to protect my familys future and yourself rendering this help.Thanking you in anticipation of your urgent response as soon as you read this very request.

Best Regards, 

Mr.Michael Kamah and family.

DEAR FRIEND, 

I AM MRS.  SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU 
SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 
OF CONGO (DRC).  I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER, 
THIS WAS IN CONFIDENCE  CONSIDERING MY PRESENT 
CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION. 

I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND AND TWO OF OUR SONS

CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN, COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILY 
AND I SETTLED, WHILE WE LATER MOVED  TO SETTLED IN 
MORROCO WHERE MY HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER 
DISEASE. HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO 
CHANGED  MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS 
DEPOSITED IN SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER 

FORMS OF MONEY CODED FOR  SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW 

HEAD OF STATE OF (DR) MR LAURENT  KABILA HAS MADE 
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
TREASURES  DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. HENCE 

MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA TO 
STUDY THE SITUATION TILL  WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER, 
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON 
TAKING OVER (JOSEPH KABILA). ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED  BY THE 
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY 
IDENTITY  SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND 

CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM OF EIHGTEEN 
MLLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$18,000,000,00.)  WITH A 


SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING. THE  FUNDS ARE 
SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM KNOWING THE 
CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO INDICATE YOUR 
INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY RECEIVING THE 
MONEY ON OUR BEHALF.ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT 
I CAN INTRODUCE YOU TO MY SON (KONGOLO) WHO HAS THE 
OUT MODALITIES FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I WANT 

YOU TO ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT 
WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED. I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY 
PROPERTIES AND STOCK IN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND 
TO ENGAGE IN OTHER SAFE AND NON-SPECULATIVE 
INVESTMENTS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE THE HIGH 
LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY,  WHICH THIS BUSINESS 
DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND 
CONFIDENCE, WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU. IN CONCLUSION,  IF 
YOU WANT TO ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL PUT YOU IN THE 
PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE 

CURRENTLY BEING  MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER 
MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. 

FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT 
INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND FAX 
NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE 
RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS.

payment should be effected to you by the Ministry, The 
contract sum of which shall run into US$27.4 Million,

In the light of this, I would like you to forward to

 BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Dear sir / Madam 


My name is DR, ADAMS OBOZUWA., a member of the Presidential 
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up. Early last year there 
was a major oil spillage in the Niger Delta Region of 
Nigeria which rendered over 70% of the communities 
homeless.The contract was handled by a foreign firm but 
because of the huge monetary profit we envisaged we decided 
to over-invoice the contract sum. Now the contract has been 
completed and the original contractor has since been 
paid,but the contract balance of US$38 million,which 
resulted from the over invoiced contract sum that has been 
left in a suspense account with the DEBT RECONCILIATION 
COMMITTEE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE APEX BANK,is what me and my 
partners are planning to take out of the country for 
ourselves.The problem is as government officials,we are not 
suppose to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having 
foreign ones.To this end, we are soliciting your assistance 
as a foreign partner who can assist us and receive this 
amount into your account. We are ready to share this money 
with you on the basis of participation. We also have plans 
to invest part of this money in any viable business in your 
country under your care,as we are nearing our retirement 
age. In any case, I received a reference of 
you/organization from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry =91Foreign Trade Division=92 as a reputable organ that 
can assist us on this transaction. Please if you accept my 
proposal do not hesitate to send me a fax on 234 1 759 0379 
or send me an e-mail on: 
adamuohiroma, so that I can provide you with the basic 
procedures for the release of the fund. It does not matter 
whether you or your company does contract project of the 
nature described here, the assumption is that you won a 
major contract and subcontracted it to another company, 
more often than not, big trading companies or individuals 
of unrelated field win major contracts here in Nigeria and 
subcontracts same to more specialized firms for execution. 
BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit this 
money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70% 
will be for me and my partners,while 5% has been set aside 
to cover any expenses that may be incurred by both parties 
during this transaction, both local and international. 
Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost 
degree of maturity and confidentiality because I am still 
in active government service with the =93NIGERIAN NATIONAL 
PETROLEUM CORPORATION=94. If I receive your response on time, 
this whole transaction could be accomplished within the 
shortest possible time based on your interest and 
determination,since the money is already in transit. 
Please, try to call me up to confirm the receipt of your 
fax or e-mail.The lines may be busy,but keep trying till 
you get through. 

Yours faithfully, 

DR, ADAMS OBOZUWA. (MNIM)

TRANSFER OF USD$22MILLION INTO YOUR ACCOUNT}

ATTENTION: President\CEO.

I, on behalf of my other colleagues from different
organs of Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) owned
parastatals decided to solicit your assistance as
regards transfer of the above-mentioned amount into
your bank account.  This fund accrued from over
invoicing of various contract awarded in my parastatal
to certain Foreign Contractors sometimes ago.

We, as holders of sensitive position in our various
parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government
to Scrutinise all payments made to certain foreign
Contractors and we discovered that some of the
contracts they executed were grossly over-invoiced
either by omission or commission.  In the process the
sum of US$27M (Twenty Seven Million US Dollars only)
was found lying in the parastatal suspense account
after the foreign contractors had been paid their
rightful dues for executing the said contracts.

We all agreed that this over-invoiced amount be
transferred (for our own use) into a bank account
provided by a foreign partner, because we are
government workers and the Code of Conduct does not
allow us to operate foreign accounts.

However, we have succeeded in transferring some of
this money precisely US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars
only) into a foreign account in MOROCCO (North
Africa), but the provider of the account in MOROCCO is
up to some mischief and refuses to comply to the
earlier mutual agreement by insisting that the total
amount be paid into his nominated bank account before
disbursement will take effect.  If for a meagre sum of
US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) we are not
compensated, is it when the balance of US$22M
(Twenty-two Million US Dollars)is transferred that we
will be sure of our full compensation? Of course, this
abuse of trust and inhumanity calls for sober
reflection and search for absolute trust.

Thus we are seeking your unwavering assistance that
the remaining amount of US$22M can be speedily
processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank
account.  On successful remittance of the fund into
your account, you will be compensated with 30% of the
amount for your assistance and services.

So far, much have been said and due to our sensitive
positions, we cannot afford a slip in this transaction
neither can we give out identity as regards our
respective offices, but whereby cordial relationship
is established, smooth operations commences, you will
be furnished with details of all you deserves to know.

I am at your disposition to entertain any question
from you with respect to this transaction, so contact
me immediately through my e:mail for further
information on the requirements and procedure for this
transaction.

Please, treat with the strictest confidentiality and
utmost urgency.

Yours faithfully,

MR FRED OBI.

Dear sir,
 
I am Dr.Mbeki Ngumeni, a native of Cape town in South
Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South
Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources.
First and foremost, I apologize for using this medium to
reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council(SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.
 
Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty-one Million, Five Hundred Thousand US.Dollars ($21,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.
 
This amount $21.5m represents the balance of the total
contract value executed on behalf of my Department by
a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials
over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor,
leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount
which we have in principles gotten approval to remit
by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer (K.T.T) to any
foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an
application through the Ministry of Justice here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges
of the former contractor to you. I have the authority
of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of
the sum will be 25% of the $21.5 million, 70% for us
and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The
business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided
you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality.
Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to
the successful execution of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me.
 
Endeavor to contact me immediately through my e- mail
to confirm whether or not you
are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will
enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry
out this deal.
 
 
I want to assure you that my partners and myself are
in a position to make the payment of this claim
possible provided you can give us a very strong
Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured
and please, remember to treat this matter very
confidential , because we will not comprehend with any
form of exposure as we are still in active Government
Service .Once again, remember that time is of great
essence in this transaction. I wait in anticipation of
your fullest co-operation.
You can contact me through this e-mail address:- mbengu@37.com
Lastly,please try to send me your telephone and fax number so     that we candiscuss in details.
 
Yours faithfully,
Dr.Mbeki Ngumeni.

Dear Sir,

Let me first apologise to you for any mbarrassment
this mail might cause you.
I am MAHOYI BELLO, a cousin to the Vice Presidentof
the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Alhaji Atiku) and
Executive Director of SADIQ PETROLUEM LTD.I have
decided to contact you for this business proposal
based on the mutual understanding I know that can
exist between us, having known that people of your
Country are trustworthy.

Since May 1999 when the new Government came to
power,large sums of money have been recovered from our
past military leaders who siphoned money from Nigeria
and deposited it in offshore accounts in
Europe,America,Asia and some parts of Africa, for
their own selfish benefits. This happened during the
military regime,Now we are under a democratically
elected government. This fund was among the money
recovered and seized by the Federal Government of
Nigeria. 

Hence, my elder cousin (Alhaji Atiku Abubakar) the
Vice-President of Nigeria is in charge of all
off-shore accounts seized and retrieved from our past
military leaders.Therefore, we urged you to assist us
provide a very vital offshore account, where the sum
of US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million) US Dollars
will be transferred for safe keeping. 

Presently, this money is in a foreign Country I cannot
mention now.Please note that other information will be
detailed to you on the receipt of your reply. My
elder cousin and I have agreed to give you (the
account owner)for this transaction 30% of the total
amount remitted while 60%is for me and Cousin Atiku,
for the purchase of foreign investments, with your
assistance after the money have been disbursed, while
10% is for expenses both of us will incur.

Note, I have been mandated by my elder cousin to
handle this deal with you, due to his position in the
Nigerian Government as the second citizen. Therefore,
if my proposal satisfies you, kindly contact me via my
e-mail address and enclose your phone and fax numbers
for urgent confidential discussion.Your letter of
acceptance indicating your personal telephone and fax
numbers to enable us move ahead.

Besides, this transaction is risk-free and hoped to
last 7 (seven) banking days upon my elder cousin
Alhaji Atiku Abubakar's authorisation.I thank you for
your expected co-operation. 

God Bless you.Best Regards.

MAHOYI BELLO.

ATTN:MANAGING DIRECTOR

I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Mr.David Agu an auditor at one of the Federal Ministries in lagos-Nigeria. 

During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $16.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Muller Robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my curiosity. 

I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.

It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. 

I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. 

If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via Fax:234-1-7597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction. I expect your urgent response. 

Regards,
David.

Dear Friend,


 My name is DR,IDRIS BELLO, a member of the Presidential 
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up.
 Early last year there was a major oil spillage in 
the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% 
of the communities homeless.
 A contract was awarded to a foreign firm to 
rehabilitate the communitties, because of the huge monetary 
profit I envisaged, we decided to over-invoice the contract 
sum.

 Now the contract has been completed and the original 
contractor has long been paid,but the contract
 balance of THIRTY EIGHT MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS
(US$38 MILLION),which resulted from the over invoiced
 contract sum has been left in a suspense account with the 
DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE,A SUBSIDIARY OF OUR APEX BANK,
 This over invoice sum is what we intend to take out of 
the country for ourselves.

The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose 
to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones.
 To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a 
foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount 
into your account.

 We are ready to share this money with you on the basis 
of participation.
we also have plans to invest part of this money in any 
viable business in your country under your care,as we are 
nearing our retirement age.

 In any case, I received a reference of you/organization

provide you with the
basic procedures for the release of the fund.

Dear Friend,


 My name is DR,IDRIS BELLO, a member of the Presidential 
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up.
 Early last year there was a major oil spillage in 
the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% 
of the communities homeless.
 A contract was awarded to a foreign firm to 
rehabilitate the communitties, because of the huge monetary 
profit I envisaged, we decided to over-invoice the contract 
sum.

 Now the contract has been completed and the original 
contractor has long been paid,but the contract
 balance of THIRTY EIGHT MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS
(US$38 MILLION),which resulted from the over invoiced
 contract sum has been left in a suspense account with the 
DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE,A SUBSIDIARY OF OUR APEX BANK,
 This over invoice sum is what we intend to take out of 
the country for ourselves.

The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose 
to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones.
 To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a 
foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount 
into your account.

 We are ready to share this money with you on the basis 
of participation.
we also have plans to invest part of this money in any 
viable business in your country under your care,as we are 
nearing our retirement age.

 In any case, I received a reference of you/organization 
from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industry =91Foreign 
Trade Division=92as a reputable organ that can assist us on 
this transaction.

 Please if you accept my proposal do not hesitate to reply 
to me on my e-mail:(bello_dd@doctor.com)or
(obilolo@netscape.net) so that I can provide you with the 
basic procedures for the release of the fund. 

 It does not matter whether you or your company does 
contract project of the nature described here, the 
assumption is that you won a major contract and 
subcontracted it to another company, more often than
not, big trading companies or individuals of unrelated 
field win major contracts here in Nigeria and subcontracts 
same to more specialized 
firms for execution.

 The BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit 
this money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire 
funds, 70% will be for me and my partners,while 5% has been 
set aside to cover any expenses that
may be incurred by both parties during this transaction, 
both local and international.

 Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost 
degree of maturity and confidentiality because 

I am still in active government service with the NIGERIAN 
NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION.

If I receive your response on time, this whole transaction 
could be accomplished within the shortest possible time 
based on your interest and determination,since the money is 
already on transit.

 Please, try to call me up to confirm the receipt of this e-
mail on my confidential TEL/FAX: 234 1 759 0379.
 The lines may be busy,but keep trying till you get 
through. 

Yours faithfully, 

DR,IDRIS BELLO..

Office of the Financial Controller 
Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation 
Falamo Ikoyi Lagos-Nigeria. 
Tel/ Fax: 234 1 7592865. 

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS TRANSACTION. 
Dear Sir,
I am Dr.John Ejime,the financial controller of the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation Headquarters Lagos. I am writing you on behalf of my colleagues
in the corporation and have been assign to seek for the assistance of a
reliable foreign company through which we can transfer the sum of Thirty
Five Million United States Dollars Only (US$35,000,000). This fund is deposited
in the Corporation Treasury account with the Apex Bank. 
ORIGIN OF THE FUND: 
This sum arose from the deliberated over-invoicing of a contract awarded
by my ministry Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation to foreign firm in
the twinlight days of the last military regime. This contract has been completely
executed and commissioned and the contractor that handled this contract
has collected his full and final payment thus leaving behind the above stated
amount which represent the over invoiced sum. We have been safeguarding
this money for conducive time for it's transfer out of the country for our
personal use. However, the code of employment does not allow us (civil servant)
to own and operate foreign account and because the contract was handled
by a foreign firm and the payment made in dollars, we now need a foreign
partner that will present himself as the sub-contractor so that the fund
will be transfer into your company's or personal account. Your address was
made available to us by a very good friend who work with the Nigeria export
promotion council and he assured us of your company's viability and capability
in business transaction. This assurance gave us the courage to link you
up in this particular transaction and I hope it will be of mutual benefit
to all of us. Note that the nature of your business is not particularly
relevant to the success of the transaction. All we require is your willingness
to present yourself as the subcontractor by providing your bank information
so that the fund will be transferred into your account. 
SHARING RATIO:
 For your assistance in this business , your share will be 30% of the total
fund. I and my colleagues will take 60% while we set aside 10% for any expenses
that may incurred in the course of this transaction. If you are willing
to assist us in this business. Send the following information. 
1. Name of your bank and address 
2. Your account number/beneficiarys name. 
3. Your private telephone and fax number for easy communication. 
This information will enable us put an application for payment approval
to the concerned Ministries and final to the Senate Committee on Contract
Payment and it is going to last for fourteen working days starting from
the day we receive the above information. All modalities for the take off
of this transaction have been worked out and further action will commence
immediately we hear from you. I am waiting for your reply by fax on this
fax number :234-1-7592865 as stated above. 
Yours faithfully. 
Dr.John Ejime.

Subject: BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Importance: HIGH


Good day,
 This might seem very deplorable for a person that you do not know. My name is Clement Apute,I am a lawyer and a very close confidant to my client who also happens to be my sister-in-law.
 
I am contacting you because of the my client's urgent need to go into partnership with someone,who is not from this country, as a result of their family's present situation in the country,and specifically because you have a fixed address or let me say fixed responsibilities, which can stands as a good reason to go into partnership with you. 

The present situation right now, requires good understanding and a good sense of judgment.

My sister-in-law and her entire family are really suffering from the hands of some wicked people who are drunk with power.This is just a personal vendetta by the head of states, because he was jailed by my client husband's regime in 1997, for actually plotting a coup d 'etat against their military administration then, when they were in power. 

It is very clear that our present head of states wants to take advantage of his seat in power to settle his personal hatred for my client's family.

This man is bent on destroying my client's family. The family has virtually lost all their family's money and properties due to this vindictive administration in power now. who are bent on dealing with the family.

All their bank accounts have been frozen,assets and their properties which I helped in managing have been confiscated and are still non functional till this present day.
 His administration has spread so much rumors against their family, which is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of
hatred to my client's family. 

Right now it is completely impossible for any member of the family to make any move because the entire family are being placed under traveling restrictions.About a few months ago we were squished out of another US$395 million dollars, and these wicked people have completely dammed the fact that all this funds can be ascertained for independently.
 
Presently, the family is finding it very hard to manage as we have completely run out of resources, because everything has been taken away from madam and her children. My client needs sombody that she can confide in,presently the family still has some amounts of money to the sum of 84 million US dollars and some fractions in cash,which the family has spread out and lodged in the vault of different Securities outfits in two countries there in Asia and also in Europe.

The existence of these monies is not in any way known to anybody else,not even all mama's children, apart from her eldest son. The money was lodged in as jewelry. This is a precaution to maintain a very high level secrecy, because this is all the family have left to fall back on. So we expect you to keep this matter in confidence.

Madam wants a partner to proceed as soon as possible and retrieve some money lodged in any of this security outfits and handle it as duly instructed. The family needs somebody to help them withdraw there deposits because the family is financially down here in the country, since everything they own here have been taken away from them. We are looking for an understanding partner that can work with us. 

All we require from you is to help the family
to go and retrieve any one of the family's deposits that is lodged in one of these places and keep safely in your care, since none of us is able to travel out of this country due to traveling restrictions.

Secondly,so that you can always withdraw little part out of their money that will be in your possession and send it down here to us here,anytime the family is in great need. In this way they can continue to sustain the family until they are free from thier enemies.
 As their lawyer i will be instructing, on how you will go about that. We will be providing you with
all the legal documents to make claim on behalf of my client. 
Please be rest assured that you will have no problems or difficulties in claiming any of these deposits because nobody is aware of the existence of this money. All the details will be given to you when we open up negotiations and arrive at a reasonable compromise and until I gain your trust to see that we can work together.

 We will negotiate on a certain percentage share of the money that the family will offer to you for your expected assistance and partnership. 

Please do inform me on your decision immediately, so as to stop further contacts. I await your response. NOTE - You can also get in contact with me via my secured
email:clem-aputa@earthling.net
 
I will like to have your private phone number so that we can discuss better. 

Regards, 


Clement Apute. Esq.

Dear Sir I am mr Godwin Igbunu, the Bank Manager of Regent Bank of Nigeria, Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1997, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger Berget made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$8,000,000.00 (Eight Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, Ministry of Defence headquater in Abuja that Mr. Roger Berget died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin to date has fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger Berget did not declare any kin or relations in!
 all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$8,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Berget so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names, address, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and not!
arization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer. A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me, 25% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on either sides during the course of this transaction. There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via this email address. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction better. Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transactio!
n would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Looking forward to hearing from you soonest. Best regards, Mr Godwin Igbunu Please you can also reach me with this email address igbunu2@caramail.com and telephone number 234-80232-97216

ATTN:MANAGING DIRECTOR

I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Mr.David Agu an auditor at one of the Federal Ministries in lagos-Nigeria. 

During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $16.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Muller Robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my curiosity. 

I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.

It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. 

I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. 

If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via Fax:234-1-7597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction. I expect your urgent response. 

Regards,
David.

Dear friend,

 RE save our soul


   I am Mrs. Deborah Kabila, one of the wives of Late
 President Laurent D. Kabila of Democratic Republic of
 Congo (DRC).

 Consequent upon the assassination of my husband, I am
 in possession of USD 58,000,000 (Fifty Eight Million
 US Dollars Only) being funds earlier earmarked for
 special projects.  This fund has since been deposited
 in a security company in West African Country of Togo
 where I am residing now with my children.

It is now my intention to move the said fund out of
 this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of
 my children and I, for immediate investment.  Based on
 this that I solicited for your assistance to enable me
 take this money out of Togo.

 However, note that my children and I have agreed to
give you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the
 offer of assisting us.  Also it will be your
 responsibility in directing us on a viable business.
 It is also my intention to relocate and probably take
 a temporarily resident in your country pending when
 all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We
 advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon
 as we arrived.

 To conclude this transaction, you will be required to
 come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in
 Togo where the security company will deposit the total
 sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be
 remitted into your original bank in your country.
 Immediately this done, all of us will depart Togo to
 your country, where my children and I are expected to
 take a temporary resident.

 Please note that I can not open any Bank account with
 my name because, My late husband's first
 son-JOSEPH-who took over power in our country, don't
 want to see me and my children, He claimed that when
 our husband was alive, that I was very close to him
 than any other of his wives including his (Joseph)
 mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness
 to him that I was able to get things from him more
 than others. As a result he has been monitoring me.
 Infact this one of the main reasons I want to take my
children out of our country and any nearby country.


 Thanking you in advance.

Yours faithfully,

 Deborah Kabila (Mrs.)
 N/B: Kindly give me your direct telephone,fax and your mobile telephone numbers for
 more explanations.

AFEX BANK OF AFRICA
MOHAMMED BELLO (Ph.D)
Director/Coordinator 
Forex & Computer Operations Department
Tel/Fax: 234-9-2726223

Sir,

Accept my apologies for writing to you in this mode for it might be of inconvenience to you but due to my quest for an honest and reliable international assistance concerning a business here in my country Nigeria I have no other option than to go this length. I need the effectiveness of your professionalism in accomplishing this very business. I am DR. MOHAMMED BELLO Director/coordinator Forex and computer operations department of the Afex Bank of Africa PLC. 
I am writing this letter to ask your support and cooperation to carry out this business opportunity in my department.  We discovered an abandoned sum of $42.500,000.00 (forty two million, Five hundred thousand United States Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our customer in Afex Bank of Nigeria, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent (a French citizen and an Engineer executing major Federal contract with governments of West African sub region). He died with a fellow business associate in a ghastly auto crash last October and his remains have since been incarcerated. Since his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and put claims as the next of kin and beneficiary to the resources in Monsieur. Ives Laurent account, for it is against the ethics and norms of the finance institution to claim such resources without a beneficiary unless proclaimed by the government.
The federal government of Nigeria has given directives to finance institutions to declare adamant accounts that has stayed more than 8months in their custody as they intend to use it to pay off her military peace keeping force (ECOMOG) who fought in War ravaged African countries precisely and as the case may be, Late Monsieur. Ives Laurent account fell into this category thus the necessity for contacting you for I am determined to move this fund out as the rigorous and rash economic decision and policies has really turned we government workers to mere civil laborers. I have worked for almost a decade and half and I have nothing to show as reaps and rewards of my hard earned labor.        
As I need a next of kin/beneficiary and financial assistance to re-claim this resources for I cannot take on this project alone. My attorney and I have propose a commission of 25% out of the total resources for your kind assistance and five 5% has been mapped out to be reimbursed to both parties as sundry expenses incurred in the course of this business.
To commence this transaction, I require you to immediately indicate your interest by a return correspondence to this fax number 234-9-2726223 and enclose your private contact telephone number, fax number, full name & address, and your designated bank coordinates to enable us file a letter of claim to the appropriate departments for necessary approvals before the transfer could be made.  Note also that this business must be kept strictly confidential because of its nature and can be finalized within a short time depending on the level of your commitment/swiftness.
I look forward to receiving your prompt response.
Best regards, 

MOHAMMED BELLO (Ph.D)

Presently, all their foreign and local count was frozen and their assets confiscated.

She wishes to invest the a for mentioned sum on real estate property/viable inves!
tments overseas. For obvious reasons, my client does not want to place this fund with established financial institution with the family name forsecurity reasons. It is her desire that the deal be handled as quietly as possible without possibility of any leakage to the public or Government. She has therefore empowered me to find and negotiate for a reliable and trustworthy foreigner who can assist us by using his/her name in moving the money to a foreign safe account and who can assist to invest the fund properly for the family. If you agree to act as a fund manager for my client and the family, I shall release the sum of $75 USD[seventy five million united states dollars] to you if you meet my requirements.The money is available safe with a private security company coded and lodged in with a fictitious name. Upon a favorable response from you, I shall let you know the steps involve. Your commission shall be down payment of 25% of the total sum, and annual 10% of the after ta!
x returns on investment for the first 5 years. Thereafter, the terms shall be re-negotiated. If you are capable and willing to participate in this 
transaction contact me through ga_m@epatra.com 
IF FOR ANY REASON YOU ARE NOT DISPOSED AT MOMENT TO 
UNDERTAKE THIS DEAL,LET ME KNOW ON TIME SO AS TO MAKE ALTERNATIVE
ARRANGEMENT.BECAUSE I WILL NOT CONACT ANOTHER PERSON UNTILL I HEAR FROM YOU.

KINDEST ATTENTION,

PLEASE PERMIT ME TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE IN SO INFORMAL A MANNER.
THIS IS NECESSITATED BY MY URGENT NEED TO REACH A DEPENDABLE AND
TRUSTWORTHY FOREIGN PARTNER. THIS REQUEST MAY SEEM STRANGE AND
UNSOLICITED BUT I CRAVE YOUR INDULGENCE AND PRAY THAT YOU TAKE MY
REQUEST VERY SERIOUS.

I AM MR PETER WILLIAMS, A REKNOWNED BUSINESSMAN IN ONE OF THE
REBEL-HELD TOWNS, BOUAKE (ONE OF THE WAR ZONES IN IVORY COAST)
I RECEIVED INFORMATION FROM A RELIABLE SOURCE WHO DESCRIBED YOUR
COUNTRY AS BEING ECONOMICALLY CONDUCIVE FOR INVESTMENT
AND HER PEOPLE AS TRANSPARENT AND TRUSTWORTHY TO ENGAGING BUSINESS
WHICH MADE ME TO WRITE YOU. AS YOU MAY WANT TO KNOW
AND TO MAKE YOU LESS CURIOUS,I GOT YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS FROM AN
INTERNET SITE THAT PORTRAYED YOU (YOUR ESTABLISHMENT) IN GOOD
LIGHT.

ON THE 17TH OF SEPTEMBER 2002. THE REBEL LEADERS, UNTIL THEN WERE
LOYAL SOLDIERS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF PRESIDENT LAURENT GBAGBO 
CONTACTED ME IN MY OFFICE WITH THE BUSINESS OF IMPORTATION OF
ARMOURIES. WITHOUT THE PREMONITION OF WAR, I ACCEPTED THE JOB. THE
SOLDIERS PAID ME THE SUM OF TWENTY MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND
UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$ 20.5) ON THE SPOT AND TOLD ME TO EXPEDITE
ACTION. SINCE I AM NOT INTO IMPORTATION OF ARMUNITIONS AND BECAUSE OF
THE URGENCY, I IMMEDIATELY STARTED MAKING SEVERAL CONTACTS WITH
BUSINESSMEN ACROSS THE GLOBE.

TWO DAYS LATER, HEAVY FIGHTING BROKE UP IN CENTRAL BAOUKE AND
KORHOGO, EVERYWHERE WAS IN DISSARRAY AND I LOST EVERYTHING THAT TOOK
ME SO MANY YEARS TO ACQUIRE. I HAVE NO OPTION THAN TO DO AWAY WITH
THE US$20.5M.


MY WIFE AND I QUICKLY MADE AN ARRANGEMENT WITH A RED CROSS RELIEF
WORKER WHO USED HIS OFFICIAL VAN TO MOVE THIS MONEY TO ABIDJAN,
ALTHOUGH HE DID NOT KNOW THE REAL CONTENT OF THE BOX.  PRESENTLY,
THIS FUND HAS BEEN DEPOSITED WITH A SAFE RELIABLE SECURITY COMPANY IN
ABIDJAN WHERE I AM HIDING FROM THE REBEL WHO DECLEARED ME WANTED. I
DO NOT WANT TO INVEST THIS MONEY IN ABIDJAN DUE TO UNFAVORABLE
ECONOMIC CLIMATE.  AS A RESULT, I KEPT THE MONEY IN A CUSTOM BONDED
WAREHOUSE WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY.  SO THAT I CAN NOT LAY MY HANDS
ON IT UNTIL
IT GETS TO YOUR COUNTRY, WHERE I WILL COMMENCE INVESTMENT.

THE ONLY ASSISTANCE WE NEED FROM YOU WHICH I BELIEVE
YOU WOULD DO FOR US ARE THE FOLLOWING:

1. MAKE IMMEDIATE ARRANGEMENT TO TAKE THE DELIVERY OF
THE CRATE (FUND) AT THEIR EUROPE OR AMERICAN
COMMISSION AGENTS.
2. ASSURANCE FROM YOU THAT YOU WILL NOT SIT ON OUR
SHARE WHEN THIS FUND GETS TO YOUR COUNTRY.

MY WIFE AND I AGREED THAT YOU SHALL BE ENTITLED TO 20% OF THE TOTAL
AMOUNT WHILE THE PRINCIPAL SUM WILL BE INVESTED IN A VIABLE BUSINESS
VENTURE WITH YOUR ADVICE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, I WILL LIKE TO BUY A
PERSONAL HOUSE WHERE MY WIFE, MY TWO SONS AND I WILL RESIDE.

UPON CONFIRMATION OF YOUR INTEREST TO HELP US AS OUR FOREIGN PARTNER
TO CLAIM THE CRATE FROM THE SECURITY COMPANY ON OUR BEHALF AT ANY OF
THEIR COMMISSION AGENT CLOSER TO YOU, I SHALL FURNISH YOU WITH THE
DETAILS OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE CONSIGNMENT TO BE SCHEDULED IN YOUR
FAVOUR BY THE SECURITY COMPANY PREPARE AN AIRWAY BILL AND TAG THE
CONSIGNMENT IN YOUR FAVOUR.  YOUR PRIVATE FAX AND TELEPHONE NUMBERS
ARE NEEDED TO ENHANCE THE SPEEDY CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION (OUR
ONLY HOPE IN LIFE NOW) URGENTLY.
KINDLY TREAT AS URGENT AND CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY THROUGH THE ABOVE
E-MAIL ADDRESS {PANMENTAT@REDIFFMAIL.COM OR PANMENTAT@PHANTOMEMAIL.COM}.
I HAVE NOT ACQUIRED A NEW PHONE AS I LOST ALL MY PROPERTIES IN BOAUKE

YOURS FAITHFULLY,

MR PETER WILLIAMS

Good Day,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and send my best wishes in this special season.

However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you, as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I also sincerely seek your confidence, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. 

My Uncle(Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of direction. I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more interested in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek!
 political asylum.

I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit. 

President Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.

Your role in this project, is clearing the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. 

I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the consignment containing the funds, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 

Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

Fax: Number +23417597019 

Dear Sir,

I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of assistance in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Daniel Osondu an auditor at one of the Banks in lagos-Nigeria. 

During our last audit exercise,some amount of money totalling $18.5Million was discovered and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Manfred Becker, a foreigner who died in a crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted our curiosity. 

I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his confidential document with the Ministry that he executed the contract for and also with our Bank. A panel setup by the Federal Government on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be unquestionably claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or alternatively the fund should be donated for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail.

It is because of the perceived possibility of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Thomas Danababa , that arrangement is being made for the fund to be declared UNCLAIMABLED and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and ammunition which will further enhance the perpetration of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my colleagues and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad. 

I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that effect.All documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free involvement. Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in 
course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for investment purposes in your country. If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me immediately via my confidential fax number +23417597019 furnishing me with your most confidential telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the transaction. 

I expect your urgent response. 

Regards,
Mr. Daniel Osondu

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.

EMAIL:   williamsd1@rediff.com

Dear Friend,
 
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so
informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent
need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and
unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray
that you view it seriously. My name is MR WILLIAMS DANIEL of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the
close aides to the former President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed
memory, may his soul rest in peace.
 
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my
colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. But when President Kabila was killed in a
bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately 
decided to divert the fund into a private security
company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security
of the said amount is presently being threatened here
following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col.
Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila)
a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from
our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent
Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy
foreign partner who can assist us to move this money
out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under
Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe
in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic
Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not
pass through normal custom/airport screening and
clearance.
Our inability to move this money out of Congo all
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed
good friends (western countries) who suddenly became
hostile to those of us who worked with the late
President Kabila, immediately after his son took
office. Though we have neither seen nor met each
other, the information We gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and
convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this
transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The
said money is a state fund and therefore requires a
total confidentiality.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email
address above with your telephone, fax number and
personal information to enable us discuss the
modalities and what will be your share
(percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You
to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter
extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision,
while I await your prompt response. Thank you and
GodBless.
 
Best Regards
MR WILLIAMS DANIEL

FromLEONARD OBI Esq c/o The Abacha's Family
Legal Adviser (Abacha's Family Estate) 
Direct  Tel:234-1-4705964.

Attn.:  The President/CEO


I am  Dr. (Mrs.) Maryam Abacha, wife to the late
Nigeria Head of State - General Sani Abacha. I am
proposing this business to you because we could be of
great assistance to each other, likewise developing a
cordial business relatinship.

I currently have within my reach the sum of Twenty-Five
Million, Six Hundred Thousand United States Dollars 
(US$25,600,000:00)cash which I intend to 
use for investment purpose specifically in your country. 

This money came as a result of a pay back contract 
deal between my late husband and a Russian firm 
on our country's Multi-billion Dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. 

The Russian partners returned my husband's share of
US$25.6 million after his death and lodged it with my
husband's security firm in Nigeria of which I am adirector.
Right now, the new civilian government has revoked our
licenses that allow us to own a financial and oil
company. 

In view of this, I acted very fast to
withdraw the US$25.6 million from the company's vault
well preserved and packaged in trunk boxes and
deposited it in  ECOWAS Security Bank. I have since
declared our  security company bankrupt. No record 
ever  existed concerning the money neither is the
money traceable by the government because there is no
document showing that we received the money from the
Russians.

Due to the current situation in the country concerning
the government attitude towards my family, it has
become quite impossible for me to make use of the
money within, thus I seek your assistance to move the
money out of this country. On your consent, I shall
expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss
in detail about this transaction. Bearing in mind that
your assistance is needed to transfer this fund.
Your urgent response is highly needed.  All
correspondences must be channeled to our legal adviser

Leonard Obi Esq  through  his direct Tel. No:

234-1-4705964. I must also use this opportunity to
implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep
this transaction a confidential issue. You can also
contact me directly on  my secret  telephone:-234-1-4705964
if there is need.

Thanks and God bless you.

DR. (MRS.) MARYAM ABACHA.

Dear Sir,

First I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being very CONFIDENTIAL. 
I am a Senior Manager with a commercial bank . I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign country.

THE PREPOSITION
The late  JERRY ADAMS a Foreigner and an oil merchant / contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria until his death four years ago in a plane crash, banked with us  and had a closing balance of USD10,000,000.00 (Ten Million United States Dollars).

The bank now unquestionably expect it to be claimed by JERRY ADAMS next of kin. Efforts have been made by my bank to get in touch with any of the ADAMS Family but to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate JERRY ADAMS next of kin (NOK) that the management under the influence of our Executive Director has agreed that since the incident occurred in 1997 and has left the fund dormant and devalued, we should transfer the fund overseas and utilize it either on stock exchange market or personal business interest.

Your role is very important as the fund when concluded on transfer would be justifiably presented as having been remitted to JERRY ADAMS next of kin (NOK)  . Your interest will be protected as unnecessary documentation will be avoided. Note that all modalities necessary for execution of the business have been perfected. 

The money will be shared equally i.e 50% for you 50% for us, expenses too will be shared equally .

It is a risk-free deal.

Dear Sir, 
 
With profound interest and in utmost confidence, I am 
soliciting your immediate assistance or co-operation 
as to enable us round up an opportunity within my 
capability as a result of the death of one of our 
contractor (Beneficiary). 
 
I am Ademola Benson, Chief Auditor, Special Project 
and Foreign Contract Regularization and Disbursement, 
in the Office of the Auditor General of the Federation 
of Federal Republic of Nigeria. We work in hand with 
the Senate Committee on Foreign Contract Payment. Our 
duty is to ensure that all contractors are paid 
their contract sum in due time. 
 
This last payment quarter, a total of 30 contractors 
were short listed for payment and about 25 of them 
have been paid remaining about 5 (Five), information 
reaching this office indicates that one among the 
remaining has been reported dead. His name is Mr. 
Gerrand Schwartz from Sweden, he died in the last Air 
France Concorde plane crash. Meanwhile he finished the 
execution of his contract December 19th 1999. But 
since his death, nobody has come forward to put a 
claim to his contract fund which is about 
US$7,500,000.00 Million (seven Million five hundred 
thousand U.S Dollars) that is why I need your 
immediate assistance to expedite the transfer of the 
contract amount. 
 
With my position as a Director in the Department of 
Contract Regularisation and Disbursement, I will 
regularize all the necessary documents and present 
your company as the bona-fide beneficiary of this fund 
in as much as you respond within 48 hours for 
respect of this important message. Your unreserved

Greetings, 
 
This letter might surprise you because we have not met neither in person nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get to know somebody either in physical or through correspondence. I got your contact through some discreet inquiry from the chamber of commerce and industry, you and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private entrepreneurship, one has no doubt in your ability to handle a financial business transaction.
 
However,I am the first son of his Royal Majesty, Iginawari Nweke Adisaraki III  and the traditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 28,000,000.00 (Twenty eight million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late father. This money was accumulated from royalties paid to my father as compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But before his he called my attention and informed me that he lodged some funds on a two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary status. The lodgment Security Code Number was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria.
 
So this is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment purposes.  So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the funds can be moved in your name and particulars to any country of your choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when due. 
 
But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss physically on Investment entials.Based on this instance I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20% of the total money and annual 5% of the after tax returns on investment for the first three years. Thereafter, the term shall be varied. 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may arise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The balance of 70% you will invest and manage for my family. I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not drug money and it is not money from arms deal.
Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this matter. 
 
I will give you all proof of deposit and existence of money once urged and fully satisfied with you capability and honesty. I hope this will be the beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family. Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interest, kindly inform me immediately so that I will look for another contact.
 
I required also your private phone and fax numbers for easy communication.I am waiting for your quick response through my private phone or fax Number.
 
I am waiting for your quick response. 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
Prince Tunde Olusola Adisaraki (For the Family)

I am Dr Luisa Pimentel Estrada, the wife of Joseph Ejercito Estrada,former president of Philippines. I have children with my husband Jose, Jacqueline and Jude.Two sons and a daugther.This mail may be coming to you as a surprise or an article but it is very real.

I gave the mail to my daugther Jude to send the mail to any contacts she sees and may be a God fearing person will listen to our plight.I will want you as the receiver to read through it and think very well if you can help or render us any assistance. My husband Joseph Ejercito estrada was elected as the 13th President of the Philippines in May 1998 by the people of Philippines due to his popularity in the film industry made him to win the largest popularity in the history of election in Philippines.He has attain the position of Senate in 1987,then vice-president in May 1992 and later become the president 1998.My husband became mayor of his hometown, San Juan in 1969 but it was 1972 that he had a string of public successes. My husband was named one of the ten Outstanding Young Men in Public Administration. He was also named Most Outstanding Mayor and Foremost Nationalist and Most Outstanding Metro Manila Mayor.

 My husband is recently accused of illegal acquire some four Billion Peso ($80M) during his 31 months in office as President backed up by an uprising of mass Demonstrators and Senate Traitors. They also said that he has skimmed off tobacco excise Taxes benefitting from government business deals.Most of them benefitted from my husband's generousity when he was in office. But they just turned around to be the ones to impeach him. I have tried every possible means to get him out of Detention without success. The Despotic forces in power appear bent in deriding him, rubbishing his achievements while freezing all his known Bank accounts.He has been accused of economic plunder carrying the maximum penalty of death. To the worst of it all,all other wives of my husband especailly Guia Gomez and some of his children born outside wedlock are testifying against us.In conjunction with the PCGG funded by the recent President Arroyo Macapagal Gloria. These are some of the allegations file!
 before my husband in the impeachment trial; 

1. Gov. Luis Singson, a longtime friend of my husband, said he provided the my husband with more than $8 million in payoffs from illegal gambling and $2.7 million from tobacco taxes. 

2. Witnesses testify one of an account in the Philippines third largest bank held millions of dollars in bribes collected by my husband. Equitable PCI Bank President George Go resigns. The banks senior vice president, Clarissa Ocampo, said she saw my husband sign a false name to documents withdrawing $10 million from a secret personal account. 

3. On Dec 31 Five synchronized bomb attacks kill 22 people and injure more than 120 in Manila, days before the trial is to return from holiday recess. Police accuse Muslim rebels but many fear the bombs may be linked to the trial. 


4. That my husband received about $8.5 million in pay-offs from illegal gambling operators. 5. That my husband participated in a real estate business controlled by me and my son Jose despite a prohibition on outside business interests while in office. My husband is suffering from bronchitis and emphysema right now and he detained at the Veterans Memorial Medical Center in Quezon City in hospital prison outside Manila where the life of my husband is in danger.I will let you know that it is political motivated by Gloria Arroyo.Meanwhile,the government has said that it may drop rebellion charges against my husband allies Senator Juan Ponce Enrile and the former ambassador to the United State Ernesto Maceda because they were in the side of my husband,both men were later jailed by the government of Gloria Arroyo that they instigated a march on the presidential palace by 50,000 supporters of my husband.These are all political.All these are done to have my husband death. Presently !
life has not been easy for my children and I,my travelling documents have been seized by the government and they restricted me and my children to have access to my husband.

 Haven seen the way things are going with us.He decided to let me know that he deposited some money with Bank in Europe.He said that he deposited the sum of twenty Million dollars $20,000,000 in Banesto Bank Valencia Spain.Now I want to start a new life with the money.I want to invest the money outside Philippines. What I am begging you is to assist me in receiving the money on my behalf. I have discussed with the lawyer here in Metropolitan Manila and the chairman of the International Credit Commission in Madrid about this arrangement,they assured me that the money will be release to my representative.In that regards,I have gone to collect the documents needed from Gomez Carlos who my husband kept the documents with.

ABACHA COURT 
GIDADO ROAD 
KANO - NIGERIA 

ATTENTION:C.E.O 

I am lady Maryam Abacha, wife of the late General Sani 
Abacha,ex-military Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria who 
died on the 8th of June 1998 of heart problems.

I contacted you because of my need to deal with person/persons who my 
family and I have had no previous personal relationship with. 

An adventist friend of the family introduced you to me. Since the death 
of my husband, my family had been subjected to all sorts of harrassment 
and intimidation with lots of negative reports emanating from the 
government and the press about my husband. 

The present Government has also ensured that our bank accounts are 
frozen and all assests siezed. 

It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in 
the transfer of the sum of US$100Million only being the very last of my 
family fund in my possession and control. 

The Federal Government have seized all our properties and frozen all 
our accounts both local and international, but my only hope now is the 
available US$100Million cash, which I carefully packaged and deposited 
with a security finance company in Holland.

My purpose of contacting you is for someone who will be able to pay the dumurrage charges incured in the security finance company and also after transfering the 
funds, will be able to invest the funds on my behalf till such a time 
when I will be free from my present predicament.


Your benefit I can assure you will be very substantial. 

Please ensure to keep this proposal very secret and confidential for 
obvious reasons and send to us your private telephone and fax numbers for 
easy and confidential communication. 

We await your immediate response. 

Sincerely yours, 

LADY MARYAM ABACHA

FROM: DR. OBOH LUIS (alternative email 
address:rimomoh1@hknetmail.com).

Compliments of the season. I would like to firstly send to 
you the best wishes of good health and success in your 
pursuits particularly through my proposal as Contained in 
this letter. Before going into details of my proposal to 
you, I must first implore you to treat with the utmost 
confidentiality, as this is required for its success. 
My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal 
Government of Nigeria,s Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who 
are interested in diverting some funds that are presently 
floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria. 
In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your 
assistance to enable us transfer into your nominated 
account the said floating funds. We are determined to 
conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter of 
2003. The source of the funds is as follows: During the 
last military regime in Nigeria, government Officials set 
up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were 
grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and 
parastatals. The present civilian government set up the 
contract Review Panel, which has the mandate to use the 
instruments of payments made available to it by the decree 
setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if 
necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts. 
My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of 
these funds which are presently floating in the Central 
Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would like to 
divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue 
of our positions as civil servants and members of this 
panel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the 
names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have 
therefore been mandated, as a matter of trust by my 
colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas 
partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of 
U.S.$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five million, five hundred 
thousand U.S.dollars). That is why I am writing you this 
letter.
We have agreed to share the money to be Transferred into 
your account, if you agree with our proposition as 
follows; (i) 20%to the account owner (you). ( ii) 70% for 
us (the panel officials (iii)10% to be used in settling 
all expenses(by both you and us) incidental to the 
actualization of this project.
We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project 
in foreign stock markets and other business till we are 
ready and able to have access to them without raising any 
eyebrows here at home. Please note that this transaction is 
100% safe and risk-free. We
Intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking 
days from the date of receipt of the following information 
through the fax number stated above_-:Your Bank's name, 
Company=92s name, address, telephone and fax numbers and the 
account number into which the funds should be paid. The 
above information will enable us write letters of claim and 
job description respectively. This way, we will use your 
company=92s name to apply for the payment and backdate the 
award of the contract to your company. We are looking 
forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit 
for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. 

Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using my 
direct Telephone number 234 8033064962 and my America 
Internet Fax number 1 92896 27169

It was acquired for the purpose of confidentiality. I will 
bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction 
when I hear from you.

Best regards,

OBOH LUIS

ATTN: SIR/MADAM

I understand that this letter will be of great surprise to you ,Especially
as itcomes from a stranger .I am Prince.Dennis Melange Savimbi from the
republic ofAngola.I got your contact from the internet while i was searching for a
foreignerwho can help me in this case.

On the 22nd of february 2002, the rebel leader JONAS SAVIMBI my dad was
killed.butbefore his death,he told me secretly that he deposited some money for us
in case heis killed,we should flee for our lives.the money he said was supposed to
be forammunitions.he told me that he divided the money for ammunitions and gave
some ofthe money to the head of Armed and Ammunition Procurement Division , and
sent themon a mission to NIGERIA with the sum of (US$30Million United State
Dollars) toenable them stay there and negotiate with any of the Europe or America
country asregards the buying and shipment of arms and ammunition into my country .
The moneywas conveyed to NIGERIA through diplomatic means and the other part ($25M)
wasdeposited at a Security Company in Nigeria by my father, while they were
negotiatingthe arms deal.THE MONEY HE SAID WAS DEPOSITED IN MY NAME.

During the begining part of last year ,we heard my father was dead and so,i
remebered that my dad talked about some money he kept for us in the
security vaultin Nigeria.i also remembered that he said we should immediately flee for
our saftyto anywhere that is safe.so,i decided that the money must be cleared and
used forsomething that will make us ok in life.

my mum had resolved to end the war in my country.She needed oversea medical
attention for her heart disease and as a result,she wanted us to get out
of thecountry for the sake of our safety.

So , we thus agreed to look for a God fearing person oversea who can
assist us inclaiming these fund and deposit it into his or her personal/company
account. So,Weare soliciting for your assistance on this matter ;as this stands to be
the onlyhope for the future survival of the Family cause we cannot travel out of
the countrybecause things are not yet settled. Presently we are seeking assylum in
Nigeria,since it became necessary for us to live my country completly for
securityreasons and the money is here in Nigeria in a security company ;
fortunately enoughthis company we believe is closer to us and so,we will instruct them to
airship itto netherland where they have diplomatic immunities for fear of discovery
we willdiscuss with the company as regards the money in their Nigerian Office,
but for thefact that we have not got any contact from out side Africa for now we are
unable togive the instructions. This is the more reason why we are contacting you.
Here inNigeria ;we have limited right to invest this fund ; considering the means
in whichthe money was acquired, and Nigeria been a African Nation ,Hence we took this
decision .In antipation of your assistance we have agreed to give: 30% of
the totalsum to you,10% mapped out to cover any expenses that may be incuried in
course ofthe transaction, 60% for me and my family. We wish to invest this fund in
yourcountry ,this transaction is 100% risk free as we have concluded all
necessaryarrangments before contacting you.


We expect your favourable response, indicate your private Telephone and
Fax numbersfor easy
comunication. Upon comfirming your readiness to assist we shall get all
necessarydocument including the certificate of Deposit made in your name as it was
merelydeposited by my father as family valuables.

Thanks For your Co-operation,

We expect to here from you .

Yours Faithfully,

Prince DENNIS MALANGE SAVIMBI.

I am Dr. BELLO MUSA.The chief accountant of The 
Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I
head five man tender board in charge of contract award
and payments approvals.I came to know of you in my 
search for a reliable person to handle a very
confidential transaction which involves the transfer
of a huge sum of money to a foreign account.

There were series of contracts executed by aconsortion
of multinationals in the oil industry in favour of
Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) among
which were for the following:-1. The expansion of the
pipelines network within for a crude down stream
products distribution and subsequent evacuation:- $8,
Billion United States Dollars.2. Contract for the turn around maintenance
(TAM) of the various refineries in the country $115 million Uited States
Dollars.
3. The construction of storage tanks for petrolwum
products (depots) $190 Million United States Dollars.

The original value of these contracts were delebrately
over invoiced in the sum U$69,000.00 (sixty nine Million
United States Dollars Only) which has now been
approved and is now ready to be transferred, being
that the companies that actually executed these
contracts have been fully paid the projests officially
commissioned.It does not matter whether or not 
your comapny does contracts project of that nature
described here, the assumption is that your company
won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to
other companies.

Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to
transfer the total  amount to your account for subsequent disbursement,
since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau
(civil service laws) 
from opening and or operating foreign accounts in our
names. Needless to say, the trust imposed on you at
this junction enormous. In return, we have agreed to
offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 5% shall
be set aside for incidental expenses (internal and
external) between the parties in the course of the
transaction, and the remaining 75% is for us,The
Nigerian  officials.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level
of the ministry of finance and the central bank of
Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the fund within
14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the
above stated terms.Our assurance is that your role is risk free,
I accord this transaction the legality it
deserves and for mutual security of the fund, the
whole approval procedures will be officially and
legally processed with the name of any company you may
nominate as the bonafide beneficiary of the
above mentioned amount.

Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we
shall through our same connections withdraw all
documents used from all the concerned government
ministries for 100% security risk free.Once more, I
want you to understand that having put in over 19
years in the civil service of my country, I am very careful
to have my image and career deemed.

Please contact me immediately through E-mail whether
you are or not interested in this deal, if you are
not, it will enable us scout  for another foreign partner
to carry out this deal but where you are interested 
send the required documents.One blank letter head, one
invoice sheet and your bank particulars through my
above address as time is not on our side in the business.
Send by Email for security reasons.

Thanks as I await in anticipation for your fullest
co-operation.

Very truly yours,

Dr. bello musa

I have Successfully secured the money and with the assistance of my colleague,the money has been moved out of my bank and deposited in a finances company. It was packed in three(2)metal trunk boxes as photographic materials.I would need your particulars to enable me prepare documents which will authenticate that the Consignment belongs to you as the next of kin to MR Michael Osterkamp and to enable you claim the money. 

I want to be assured of a safe account where the money will be deposited pending my arrival.This transaction is absolutely risk free with no illegal complications,I have made all necessary arrangements for a successful transaction. Before this money is entrusted 
into your care, there must be an agreement that will be  reached between us stating that: 

1.BOTH PARTIES WILL NOT FOR ANY REASON CHEAT EACH OTHER. 
2.BOTH PARTIES WILL WORK TOGETHER TO SEE THIS TRANSACTION THROUGH. 
3.A HIGH DEGREE OF TRUST AND CONFIDENTIALITY WILL BE APPLIED FOR THE SAKE OF OUR WORK.

CLAIM THIS FUND AND I AND MY PARTNER WILL ARRAGE AN 
ATTORNEY(LAWYER)WHO WILL WORK ON YOUR BEHALF TO GET THE 
NECESSARY PAPERS NEEDED FOR A SMOOTH TRANSACTION. 
5.YOU WILL NOT DISAPPEAR WITH OUR FUND AFTER YOU 
HAVECLAIMED IT. 
6.DISBURSEMENT RATIO WILL BE 70 FOR ME AND MY 
COLLEAGUE,15 FOR YOU, 5% WILL BE DONATED TO CHARITY,WHILE 
10% WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR MUTUALEXPENCES. 

There is need for you to respond to this offer immediately as the government of my country have concluded plans to apply the money into arms procurement to project wars and unrest in African continent.I must let you know that a high degree of trust is required and also we will like to use our own share to go into any lucrative business with your help/assistance. 

Awaiting your urgent response now.

Dear sir,
 
I have a proposal foryou - this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to go honour against your will.
 
 I am 35, and had worked with a bank (one of the African
 leading banks in the West Coast). Here in this bank
 existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which
 belong to a Syria national who is now late.
 
 When we discovered that there had been no deposits nor
 withdrawals from this account for this long period, I
 and my two other colleagues decided to carry out a
 system investigation and discovered that non of the
 family member nor relations of the late Syrian is
 aware of this account.
 
 This is the story in a nutshell.
 
 Now we want an account overseas where we can transfer
 this funds. Thereafter, we had planned to destroy all
 related documents for this account. It is a careful
 network and for the past eleven months we have worked
 out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation.
 
 
 The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all
 the accumulated interest the balance in this account
 stands at-US$9,000.000.00 million US dollars.
 
 Now our questions are:-
 
 1. Can you handle this project?
 2. Can we give you this trust?
 3. What will be your commission?
 
 Consider this and get back at us as soon as possible.
 
 Finally, it is our humble prayer that the information as
 contained herein be accorded the necessary
 attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves.
 
 We Expect your urgent response if you can handle this
 project. send a mail for confirmation.
 
 
 Respectfully yours,
 
 MR.Daniel Innoma.

Dear friend,

 RE save our soul


   I am Mrs. Deborah Kabila, one of the wives of Late
 President Laurent D. Kabila of Democratic Republic of
 Congo (DRC).

 Consequent upon the assassination of my husband, I am
 in possession of USD 58,000,000 (Fifty Eight Million
 US Dollars Only) being funds earlier earmarked for
 special projects.  This fund has since been deposited
 in a security company in West African Country of Togo
 where I am residing now with my children.

It is now my intention to move the said fund out of
 this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of
 my children and I, for immediate investment.  Based on
 this that I solicited for your assistance to enable me
 take this money out of Togo.

 However, note that my children and I have agreed to
give you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the
 offer of assisting us.  Also it will be your
 responsibility in directing us on a viable business.
 It is also my intention to relocate and probably take
 a temporarily resident in your country pending when
 all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We
 advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon
 as we arrived.

 To conclude this transaction, you will be required to
 come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in
 Togo where the security company will deposit the total
 sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be
 remitted into your original bank in your country.
 Immediately this done, all of us will depart Togo to
 your country, where my children and I are expected to
 take a temporary resident.

 Please note that I can not open any Bank account with
 my name because, My late husband's first
 son-JOSEPH-who took over power in our country, don't
 want to see me and my children, He claimed that when
 our husband was alive, that I was very close to him
 than any other of his wives including his (Joseph)
 mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness
 to him that I was able to get things from him more
 than others. As a result he has been monitoring me.
 Infact this one of the main reasons I want to take my
children out of our country and any nearby country.


 Thanking you in advance.

Yours faithfully,

 Deborah Kabila (Mrs.)
 N/B: Kindly give me your direct telephone,fax and your mobile telephone numbers for
 more explanations.

KAMBILI BOB
3/5 RIDES GARDEN
CLOSE JO'BURG,
SOUTH AFRICA

MY DEAR , 

I am Bob Kambili, Bank manager of First national bank
South Africa Pty, South Africa,(www.fnb.co.za) and for
reasons which will become obvious to you as read on, I
obtained your address particulars from an Internet
address listing. Please exercise some patience and
read through my message.  You can reach me immediately
on my private email address  (henryfnbsa@mail.com)

I have a very urgent and confidential business 
proposition for you. On June 6th 1998, a Gold
Consultant/Contractor with the South African National
Gold Corporation, Mr. Ahmed Youseff Mustafa , a
national of Iraq, made a numbered time ( fixed)
deposit for 12 calendar months, value 
USD52,000,000.00 (FIFTY TWO MILION DOLLAS)  in my
branch. 

On maturity, we sent a routine notification to his 
forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, 
we sent a reminder and finally, his contract 
employers, the South African National Gold Corporation
wrote to inform us that Mr. A Y Mustafa died from an
automobile accident; that he died without making a
WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin
through the Iraqi embassy were fruitless. At first I
was surprised that I did not receive much official
cooperation in my inquiries in order to trace his kin
in Iraq, and inform them about Mr. Mustafas deposit
of USD52m plus accrued interest. I therefore made
further investigations and discovered that Mr. Mustafa
had actively opposed the Government of President
Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and was consequently driven
into exile. Being an minning Expert,he subsequently
obtained a job with the South Africa Gold Coporation, 
and settled in South Africa. Thereafter, he walked
into my Office to make the aforementioned deposit of
USD52m. He did not declare any kin in his application
paperwork, contrary to laid down procedures, and when
I asked him he informed me that he wished it so. I
accepted his application because banks are
conservative and will always honour a customers
wishes, especially high networth customers. No one
knows the source of his money because apparently the
time frame of his employment with the ASGC does indeed
preclude such a large amount of money. It can be
assumed that he brought his money over from Iraq, but
that is open to speculation. However, the point is
that his employers are not aware of this money , and
therefore it can be safely assumed that no one will
ever come forward to claim this money. This money
total USD52m ( inclusive of accrued interests) is
still sitting in my Bank in the Dormant Account
Portfolio. No one will ever come forward to claim it
now, and according to South African law, 
after 5 years, the money will automatically revert 
to the Federal Government Treasury if the Account 
owner is a foreigner, is certified dead , and there is
no valid claim. This indeed, is the situation. My
proposal therefore is that I am looking for a 
foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to 
Mr. Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood 
relation to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is
not also necessary to come from the same Country. I
have worked out the modalities to achieve my aim of
appointing a next of kin, and therefore also by this
means transfer this money total USD52m abroad for us
to share. 

The method of achieving the objective of 
transferring this money abroad in a completely legal
and proper way is simple. I intend to use a n Attorney
( representing you as BENEFICIARY) to execute a series
of affidavits in support of your claim. These will be
approved. 

The money transfer paperwork itself will include a 
certificate of origin so that the receiving bank 
does not ask questions or refuse the money as money 
laundering. Also, the paperwork will include proper 
certification that the funds being transferred are 
from non criminal sources. In short this will be a 
proper and legal money transfer and there is no 
risk!.
 
I will have to process the initial paperwork to 
obtain approval from the Probate Registry ( Ministry
of Justice ) to obtain the Letter of Administration
empowering you as Sole trustee/executor to the Estate
of Mr. Mustafa. 

If you therefore agree to be the official 
Beneficiary, then please note that you will not be 
required to sign any Money Transfer Documents ( my
Attorney will do all (that), you will not be required
to come to South Africa. 

Only the following is required from you: 
(1) Send to me immediately A bank account ( a bank 
account with zero credit balance is ok) 
(2) Complete name and address of the Bank 
(3) Bank Account Number 
(4) Name of Account Holder/Beneficiary 
(5) Your address, phone and fax 
(6) A brief background information on you (CV) 
Once you send me the requested information as 
above, I will initiate the processing of the transfer
and in about 7 working days the money total USD52m
will be in your nominated bank account for us to share
in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. This
transaction is guaranteed to succeed without any
problems. If you agree to assist me by sending me the
above requested information, I will give you my
complete address, including phone/ fax etc and any
further clarifications you may require. 
Looking forward to your urgent reply. 

Yours truly 

Kambili.

FUND.
YOU MAY KNOW THAT MY FATHER WAS A REBEL LEADER IN ANGOLA BEFORE HIS DEATH AND MY REASON FOR DOING THIS IS BECAUSE IT WILL  BE DIFFICULT FOR THE ANGOLAN GOVERNMENT TO TRACE MY FATHER'S MONEY  TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S ACCOUNT, ESPECIALLY WHEN SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL HAS NO 
RELATIONSHIP WITH MY FATHER THEREBY KEEPING THAT MONEY FOR MY FAMILY USE. 
AT PRESENT THE MONEY AS I SAID IS KEPT IN A SECURITY COMPANY IN THE NETHERLAND.

DEAR,

I AM THE DIRECTOR OF BILLS AND EXCHANGE AT THE FOREIGN 
REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF OUR BANK HERE IN ABIDJAN COTE 
D=92IVOIRE.

IN MY DEPARTMENT WE DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM OF 
US$12.500,000.00 (TWELEVE. FIVE MILLION USD ONLY) IN AN 
ACCOUNT THAT BELONGS TO ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO 
DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY IN NOVEMBER 1999 IN A 
PLANE CRASH.

SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN 
EXPECTING HIS NEXT OF KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY 
BECAUSE WE CANNOT RELEASE IT UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIES FOR IT 
AS NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN 
OUR BANKING GUIDELINES.

UNFORTUNATELY WE LEARNT THAT ALL HIS SUPPOSED NEXT OF KIN 
OR RELATIONS DIED ALONG WITH HIM AT THE PLANE CRASH LEAVING 
NOBODY BEHIND FOR THE CLAIM.

IT IS THEREFORE UPON THIS DISCOVERY THAT I AND ONE OF THE 
OFFICIALS IN THE DEPARTMENT NOW DECIDED TO MAKE BUSINESS 
WITH YOU AND RELEASE THE MONEY TO YOU AS THE NEXT OF KIN OR 
RELATIONS OF THE DECEASED FOR SAFETY AND SUBSEQUENT 
DISBURSEMENT SINCE NOBODY IS COMING FOR IT AND WE DON=92T 
WANT THIS MONEY TO GO DISBURSEMENT ACCOUNT AS UNCLAIMED 
BILL.

THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATED THAT IF SUCH 
MONEY REMAINED UNCLAIMED AFTER FOUR YEARS THE MONEY WILL BE 
TRANSFERRED INTO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AS UNCLAIMED 
FUND. THE REQUEST OF A FOREIGNER AS NEXT OF KIN IN THIS 
BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMERS WAS A 
FOREIGNER AND AN IVORIEN CANNOT STAND AS NEXT OF KIN TO A 
FOREIGNER.

WE AGREE THAT 15% OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS FOREIGN 
PARTNER AND 5% FOR EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE COURSE OF 
REMITTANCE. THEREAFTER TO THE PERCENTAGES INDICATED.

THEREFORE TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THE FUND TO 
YOU AS ARRANGED. YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS A 
RELATION OR NEXT OF KIN OF THE DECEASED INDICATING YOUR 
BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER AND LOCATION WHERE IN THE MONEY WILL BE 
REMITTED . UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR REPLY I WILL SEND TO YOU 
THE TEXT OF THE APPLICATION. AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THIS 
LETTER, YOU SHOULD CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY AND INDICATE YOUR 
DIRECT AND CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE/FAX NUMBERS FOR THE 
EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION REQUIRED.

TRUSTING TO HEAR FROM YOU IMMEDIATELY ON TELEPHONE NUMBER 
0022507822694.

YOURS FAITHFULLY,

F. LAMINE
DIRECTOR, FOREIGN OPERATIONS

Dear,

I am well confident of your capability to assist me in a transaction for mutual benefit of both parties, ie(me and you) I am also believing that you will not expose or betray the trust and confidence I am about to establish with you. I have decided to contact you with greatest delight and personal respect.

I am Mr Benard Gelicah Sankoh Son to FODAY SANKOH who was arrested by the ECOMAOG PEACE KEEPING FORCE months ago in my country Sierra Leone. Few days before the arrest of my father, he confided in me and ordered me to go to his underground safe and move out immediately, with a Deposit Agreement and Cash Receipt he made with a security Company where he deposited One Iron Box containing USD$22 million dollars cash (TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS).
This money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my father and he have already decided to use this money for future investment of the family.

Thereafter, I contacted the security company and notify them with the two documents and confirmed the deposit of the box by my father.
Meanwhile, my father have instructed me to look for a trusted foreigner who can assist me to move out this money immediately for investment .

Based on this, I solicited for your assistance to transfer this fund into your Account, but I will
demand for the following requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where this fund will be transferred to in your country or another nearby country where
taxation will not take great toll on the money?

(2) Could you be able to assist me to obtain my travelling papers after this transfer to enable me
come over to meet you in your country for the investment of this money?

(3) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable business venture that would not require much technical expertise in your country where part of this fund will be invested?

Please, all these requirements are urgently needed as it will enable me to establish a stronger business relationship with you hence I
will like you to be the general overseer of the investment thereafter. I am a Christian and I will please, want you to handle this transaction based on the trust I have established on you. For
your assistance in this transaction, I have decided to offer you 15% percent commission of the total amount at the end of this business.
The security of this business is very important to me and as such, I would like you to keep this business very confidential. Upon the
receipt of your mail

I shall expect your urgent reply. 

Thank you and God bless you

Mr Benard Gelicah Sankoh.

Dear ,
 
Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that everything will 
be well at the end of the day. We have decided to contact you due to 
the urgency of this transaction.I got your email address while searching 
for a trustworthy individual.
 
Let me start by introducing myself properly to you.I am Mr. malcom tutu     ,
an auditor with Ned Credict Bank, Johannesburg, South Africa .
 
MY  PROPOSITION: 
A Foreigner a french, Late Engr.Peter Claude  (Snr) a merchant in 
The Republic of South Africa, Formerly working in  Witwatersrand Johannesburg Gold Mine, Johannesburg South Africa
until his death few year ago in Kenya Air Bus (A310 - 304)Flight KQ431,
He banked with us at Ned Credict Bank Johannesburg and had a closing 
balance as at the end of September, 2000 worth $30,800.000.00 (Thirty 
Million eight hundred United State Dollars), (this is aside the accrued
interest so far from that date) the bank now expects his next of kin 
as beneficiary. Valuable efforts are being made by the Bank to get in 
touch with any of the Claude's Family or Relatives but to no success.
Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his 
next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release 
it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the 
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we 
learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside 
with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.
 
It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate 
any of Late Engr. Peter Claude (Snr.)'s next of kin . The Management 
under the influence of our Chairman and Members of the Board of 
Directors, Thus that arrangement will be made for the fund to be decleared 
"Unclaimed" and subsequentlly be donated to the trust fund for arms and
ammunition to further enhance the course of War in Africa and the World
in General.
 
In order to avert this negative development, some of my trusted 
colleagues and I, now seek your permission to have you stand as next of 
kin to the late Engr.peter Claude  (Snr.) so that the fund will be 
released and paid into your Account as the beneficiary/next of kin.  
The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned
by the fact that the customer(Claude) was a foreigner and a Local person here 
in the country  cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.


All documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully 
worked out. We have secured from the probate registry, an order of 
Mandamus to locate any of the deceased's beneficiary(ies), and more so 
we are assuring you that this business is 100% Risk Free. Your share 
will be 30% of the total sum while 10% will be set aside for any 
expences incured during the course of transaction, The rest of 60% will 
be for myself and my colleagues for investment purposes, According to 
agreement between both parties.
 
Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as 
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin 
of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, 
your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective 
communication and location where-in the money will be remitted . I will
also instruct you on how you can add in your application to our bank so
that you get paid through our corresponding bank  overseas as this will
be easier for us. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by
fax or email the text of the application.
  
Please note that for the purposes of confidentiality, all further 
correspondeces would be through my alternative email address:macontu1@webmail.co.za
 or through my telephone +874-762919-885.
 
Accept my warm regards as I await your response.
 
Sincerely,

malcom tutu

 Good day,

It is my humble pleasure to write this letter irrespective 
of the fact 
that you do not know me. However, I came to know of you in 
my private 
search for a reliable and trustworthy person that can 
handle a 
confidential transaction of this nature in respect of this, 
I got your 
contact through an uprooted search on the internet. Though 
I know that 
a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
apprehensive and 
worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the 
end of the 
day
I am Stevens Bangura, son of late Mr John Bangura of Sierra 
Leone who 
was killed by the Sierra Leone's rebel forces on the 24th 
of 
December,1999 in my country Sierra Leone.
When he was still alive, he deposited one trunk box 
containing the sum 
of USD$30 million dollars in cash (Ten Million dollars). 
with a private 
security and safe deposit company here in Abidjan Cote 
d=B4Ivoire. This 
money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my 
mother and she 
have already decided to use this money for future 
investment of the 
family.
Recently, I rushed down to Abidjan after being able to 
locate where my 
late father kept the depository Agreement made between 
himself and the 
security company. I have confirmed from the security 
company that the 
consignment is in their custody, when I demanded for the 
release of the 
consignment to me in my capacity of being the son of Mr 
Bangura, 
the depositor of the consignment, I was told that in the 
absence of my 
father, the only person that can demand for the release of 
the 
consignment is my late father=B4s foreign partner on whose 
behalf the 
consignment was deposited.
Meanwhile, my father have instructed me that in the case of 
his death, 
that I should look for a trusted foreigner who can assist 
me to move 
out this money from C=F4te d=B4Ivoire immediately for 
investment .

Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to transfer 
this fund 
into your Account, but I will demand for the following 
requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country after 
retrieving the 
box containing the money from the custody of the security 
company.

(2) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable 
business venture 
that would not require much technical expertise in your 
country where 
part of this fund will be invested?

I am a Christian and I will please, want you to handle this 
transaction based on the trust I have established on you.
For your assistance in this transaction, I have decided to 
compensate 
you with 10 percent of the total amount at the end of this 
business. 
The security of this business is very important to me and 
as such, I 
would like you to keep this business very confidential.
I shall expect an early response from you.
Thank you and God bless.

Yours sincerely,
Stevens Bangura

Dear webmaster =2C

Union House Marina              
Lagos State
Nigeria=2E

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

Dear Sir=2Fmadam

I sincerely write to seek your co-operation and trust
to enable my colleagues and I carry out an urgent
business opportunity in my department=2E I work with the
Union Bank of Nigeria PLC=3B currently I am the senior
manager of bills and exchange at the foreign
remittance department of my bank=2E I was the account
officer to one Mr=2E Ali B=2E Ashraf who died along with
his family on the 8th of November 1996 in an ADC
Boeing 727 plane crash at Egirin River=2E All 141
passengers on board were feared dead=2E

He left in his domiciliary account the total sum of
Sixty Five Million United States Dollars =5B$65million=5D 
Since the management got the information of his
death we have been expecting any of his relation or
his next of kin to come up and claim his money=2E
Unfortunately from the day of his death till the time
of this letter none of his relation or friends has
come up for the claim=2E The banking and financial law
of Union bank of Nigeria Plc stipulates that if such
fund remained unclaimed after a period of four years =284=29 it
will be transferred into the bank treasury as
unclaimed bill=2E On this discovery sir=2C I and a colleague of mine
now decided do business with you and
release the money to you as the next of kin to Ali B=2E
Ashraf for safety and subsequent disbursement=2E I will
soon proceed for my retirement in the middle of  this year=2C and I
personally do not want this fund to be transferred
into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill=2E That is why
I wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I
proceed on my retirement from the banking services by
june 15th 2003=2E

The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this
project is occasioned by the fact that the customer
Mr=2E Ali Ashraf was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot
stand as his next of kin or heir=2E We have agreed that
15% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner=3B
thereafter my colleague and I will visit your country
for disbursement according to the percentages
indicated=2E To enable the immediate transfer of the
fund into your nominated account=2C you will first apply
to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased=2C
indicating your bank account number and location
wherein the money will be remitted=2E Upon receipt of
your acknowledgement indicating your interest=2C I will
send to you the text of the application that you will
send to the Union Bank authority for an approval to
submit your claims=2E 

Send your reply through my direct  private email
address and indicate  your direct
Fax and telephone numbers for effective communication
that this transaction is required=2E Do not reply through the
union bank email address because it will fall at the receptionist's
desk and is for public use =2E


Please note that you are not to appear in person=2C as
every thing regarding this project will be strictly on
documentations and every banking documents needed for
this transaction will be taken care of by my self=2E

Looking forward to urgently hearing from you=2E

Yours Faithfully

MR=2E DONALD  ATTAH

        TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

Dear Sir,

We want to transfer to overseas account
($26,000.000.00 USD) Twenty six million United States Dollars) from a Prime 
Bank here in South Africa, I want to ask you, If you are not capable to 
quietly look for a reliable and honest person who will be
capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a 
new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve 
to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest
to me till the end for this important business trusting in you and believing 
in God that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Jeffery Hill the Auditor General of one of the prime banks here in 
South Africa, during the course of our auditing,I discovered a floating fund 
in an account opened in the bank in 1996 and since 1998 nobody has operated 
on this account again,after going through some old files in the records I 
discovered that the owner of the account died without a
[Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out 
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is 
PEDRO F. HASLER a foreigner,a great industrialist and he died
since 1998.No other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation 
proved to me as well that until his death he was the manager GOLD ARK [pty]. 
SA.

We will start the first transfer with Six million [$6,000.000] upon 
successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall 
re-apply for the payment of the remaining rest amount to your account.

The total amount involve is Twenty six million United States Dollars only 
[$26,000.000.00]. I want to first transfer $6,000.000.00 [Six million United 
States Dollar] from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before 
the rest. But I don't know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a 
foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person here, 
without valid international foreign
passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid international 
passport or drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money is in US 
dollars and the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner too,and the money can 
only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together when we meet 
face to face after the first transfer of $6 Million before transferring the 
second part of $20 Million. I am revealing this to you with believe in God 
that you will never let me down in this business, you are the first and the 
only person that I am contacting for this business, so please reply urgently 
so that I will inform you the next step to take urgently. Send also your 
private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account 
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding 
agreement that will bind us together immediately after the first transfer 
before we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management 
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct 
information of this account, which I will give to you upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet 
up with instruction of  a key bank official who is deeply involved with me 
in this business. I need your strong assurance that you will
never, never let me down.

With my influence and my position in the bank the bank official can transfer 
this money to any foreigner's reliable account that you can provide with 
assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in 
your country for sharing. The bank official
Will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money 
leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence you can call me for 
heart to heart discussion through my private satellite phone
which I secured for the security and safety of this business as you know 
that this business is confidential.I will use my position and influence to 
obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this
money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant 
ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total 
amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might 
have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email
address.

Yours truly,
Jeffery Hill.

Dear Sir, 

I am Sam Aluko, former special adviser on Petroleum matters 
to the late 
Head of State of Government of Nigeria Gen. Sani Abacha. 
Because of my 
strategic position in the former Government and also being a 
close confidant 
of the late Head of State, I was able to acquire personally the 
sum of 
$50,000,000.00 USD ( fifty million United States Dollars only) 
presently 
lodged in a Security Deposit in Europe. I made this money 
largely through 
"CONSULTANCY FEE" and Good Faith Fees" paid by foreign Oil 
companies prior 
to Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocs and other 
Lifting/prospecting Right. 
Nigeria is the 6th largest Producer/Exporter of Crude Oil in 
the World. 

As you are probably aware of the fact that Nigeria is prone to 
Military coups and the resultant Political/Economic Instability 
has fueled 
hyper Inflation, amongst other problems. I have therefore 
resolved to 
invest my money abroad, preferable in Real Estate Properties 
and Importation 
of Goods from your country for safety and optimum returns on 
Investment. 

However the, present civilian administration of President 
Olusegun Obasanjo 
has placed a restriction of movement on every member of the 
cabinet of the 
past military government. This is as a result of the panel of 
inquiry 
slated to investigate most of the atrocities perpetrated by the 
late former 
head of state. This means that I cannot travel out now till the 
panel 
conclude its investigations which only God knows when that 
would be. 

Straight transfer of this money into a bank abroad will present 
two major 
problems one, the tax incidence will be too high, as much as 
60% of this 
money will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a result 
of Government 
deliberate restrictions on flight of capital Abroad. However 
arrangement 
have been put in place for you to receive this money from a 
trust worthy 
security Deposit Company in Europe. As soon as you indicate 
your interest. 
I will send to you the security Code number, certificate of 
deposit number 
and airway bill number of the Deposit that will serve as the 
onus of proof 
to enable you claim the Money, which is tagged, Diplomatic 
Luggage. 

All I now need is an honest partner who can receive the money 
on my behalf 
and help me to invest as aforementioned. 
There is absolutely no risk involved in this transaction, as 
the money will 
be delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills. 
If you are interested in assisting me, please send to me by 
email 
immediately your preferred contact address where you can be 
reached at any 
time, upon receipt of the money, you are to lodge this money in 
a bank 
account and contact me for necessary arrangements for the 
investment of the 
funds. For your help and assistance in this deal, you will be 
entitled to 
25% of this money in cash or Equity if you wish to join the 
proposed 
company. 

Finally you are to please urgently send to me through the 
required contact address that include your telephone and fax 
number), so 
that I can instruct the West side Deposit Company to go ahead 
with the 
transfer to you 


Best regards, 
Sam Aluko

My name is MR YARO BAMIYI=2C the eldest son of Rtd
General
BUBA S=2EG=2EBAMIYI=2C who was the estwhile Minister

confidence and trust to enable us provide a solution
to a money transfer of $25M that is presently putting
my entire family into great disarray=2E 

You may be quite surprised at my sudden contact to you
but do not despair=2C I got your contact from a business
site on the internet and following the information I
gathered about you=2C I was convinced that you could be
of assistance to me=2E So=2CI decided to contact you at
once due to the urgency required for us to immediately
transfer the said funds out of the country=2E

During the time my father was in the government with
the late General Sani Abacha as the head of state=2Cthey
were both involved in several deals that yielded
Billions of Dollars=2E The prominent amongst the deals
was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the
importation of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the
Nigerian Defense=2C funds set to embark on an oversea
ampaign to counter the United States action to put a
stop to the self succession bid of the Abacha
government to retain power=2C and monies set aside to
rehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum Refineries
and the National Electric Power Authority which
supplies Electricity to the entire nation=2E If you are
conversant with world news=2C you would understand
better=2E

During this period my father was able to make some
good money for himself and kept in his private bank
accounts=2E The then head of state General Sani Abacha
transferred his share of the money through a Lebanese
businessman=2C Chagoury and a Jewish businessman=2C Mark
Rissar to bank accounts overseas=2E Unfortunately=2C all
the secrets were revealed by the investigation
agencies set up by the successive governments and most
of the Abacha=3Fs loots were traced and repatriated
fromthe various accounts to the Federal Government
Treasury=2E

Out of the money my father made=2C he left the sum of
N50 Million =28Fifty Million Naira=29 in the CBN escrow
account for further transfer into a foreign account
and a sum of $25M =28TWENTY-FIVE Million Dollars=29 was
kept in a Private security firm here in Nigeria=2E
Through the confessions made by the Abacha=3Fs Family=2C
the N50 Million was recovered by the investigating
agency from the CBN escrow account=2E But were unable to
discover the $25M=2C which he kept in the vaults=2E The
reason is because no names were used to lodge in the
funds=2EInstead=2C he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS
=28PIN=29 and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and
Treasury Bills=2E Also the firm issued him with a
certificate of deposit of the consignments=2E Note thatI
have these information in my custody=2E

Right now=2C my father has been arrested and detained
for interrogation=2E As the eldest son of my Father=2C I
believe that I owe the entire family an obligation to
ensure that the $25M is successfully transferred
abroad for investment purposes=2E With the present
situation=2C I cannot do it all by myself=2E 

It is based on this that I am making this contact with
you=2E I have done a thorough homework and fine-tuned
the best wayto create you as the beneficiary to the
funds and effect the transfer accordingly=2E Is rest
assured that the modalities I have resolved to
finalize the entire project guarantees our safety and
the successful transfer of the funds=2E So=2C you will be
absolutely right when you say that this project is
risk free and viable=2E If you are capable and willing
to assist=2Ccontact me at once via email for more

>From The Desk of:
MR.Sadik Adebayo (FINANCIAL DIRECTOR)
UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC.

Dear Sir, 
                        BUSINESS PROPOSAL.
Please permit me to introduce myself. 
I am the Financial Director of Union Bank of Nigeria
PLC. Union Bank is one of the biggest Commercial Banks
in Nigeria. The Board of Directors of the Bank met on
the 13th of November over a matter that requires your
co-operation and assistance.
In 1996, one of our esteemed customers, Mr. Adil
Bantam, an Indonesian citizen who died in a plane
crash along with members of his family. The 
ADC plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the
coast of Lagos, killing all the passengers and crew.
Before the death of Mr. Adil Bantam, he 
was the Managing Director of Deep-blue Oil Servicing
Company. His company has both current and savings
accounts with our Bank. At the time of his death, he
had US$26.6Million in both accounts.When our Bank was 
notified of his death, we made efforts to contact his
immediate next of kin through his embassy in Victoria
Island, Lagos. The embassy later wrote to us informing
us that all attempt on their part to contact any of 
his relatives was not successful. It was at this point
we contacted the government of Nigeria through the
Ministry of Finance informing them about this problem.
The government wrote to us back directing our Bank to 
place Mr. Adil Bantam funds in a suspense account
pending when any of his relatives shows up to claim
the money. This was in 1996.
However, we received instructions from the Nigerian
Government giving us till the end of December  2002 to
disburse this fund to the next of kin of Mr. Adil
Bantam, or the money will be used to buy arms to
support the civil wars in Sierra Leone and Angola. It
was as a result of these directives from government
that made the Board of Directors of our Bank 
to meet. After careful considerations of the intention
of government to use the money to support war instead
of eradicating disease and poverty, the board then
mandated me to contact you for assistance to receive 
this money as the next of kin to Mr. Adil Bantam.
What we want to do is to present you or your company
as the next of kin to Mr. Adil Bantam which will
entitle you to receive this money on his 
behalf. It will not be difficult to establish the
relationship. You could be a relative to his later
wife or his uncle from his mothers side. 
As soon as you confirm your willingness to assist, you
shall be provided with all information relating to the
Late Mr.Adil Bantam, as contained in our file. You do
not have to worry about this proposal, as the 
Board of Union Bank is 100% behind this proposal. When
we have successfully remitted the fund in your
account, you shall assist us invest our 
shares into profitable business in your country for
2years. Your interest will be 30% of the total sum
after the successful completion of this 
transaction.Sir, should you be willing to assist in
this matter,kindly get back to me on my Telephone
number +234-803-3044193 stating your telephone and fax
numbers along with your bank detail were the money
will be transfer to and any question you may need  to
ask about this transaction. We want to assure you of a
hitch free transaction, as your involvement will not
expose you to any risks now or after the successful
completion of the transaction.
We thank you once more while we look forward to your
urgent response to this letter.

Best regards,
MR.Sadik Adebayo.

ATTN:MD/CEO

I am a Barrister and a member of Nigeria Bar Association 
(NBA). Your contact reached me through the World Business 
Encyclopedia and my insistence on you. Hence, I made up my 
mind to introduce this business to you in confidence for 
the mutual benefit of both of us. 

The sum of US$17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred 
Thousand Dollars) was lodged into one of the leading 
private Banks here in the Country by the late Head of State 
(GEN.SANI ABACHA) this money was lodged in a DEFACED FORM 
and in vaults / boxes. The money was originally meant to be 
used for his political campaign. Because I was his family 
Attorney as such he confided in me with the relevant 
document papers relating to this Bank died of cardiac 
arrest. As a matter of fact, I have adequately agreed with 
some of the key officers of the private Bank to negotiate 
with you a trustworthy person to provide an account where 
this money could be transferred to your country through 
your Bank account, because we cannot claim the money here 
in Nigeria. 

We have concluded all arrangement with an offshore Security 
Company to move this money through diplomatic means a 
country where it could be directly transferred to your 
nominated account to ensure absolute safety and risk-free 
transfer of the money. After a successful transfer, 30% 
will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 65% for us. You are required to send by e-
mail immediately your Telephone and Fax numbers and Bank 
particulars where this money will be lodged and your 
personal contact address. Once you notify me your 
willingness by sending the above requirement. This 
transaction will be concluded within 10 (ten) working days. 
I will be waiting for your urgent reply. 

Best regards, 

Barr. Femi Williams. {Attorney at Law}

Dear Sir,

I am Engr. Ugo Nzego with the Engineering Stores Department of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and 

Natural Resources and member of Tenders Board. We have urgent need for a trustworthy foreign contact 

person with whom we can carry out a successful business deal.

Federal Government has voted the sum of US$1.86 Billion for Local Production of food crops. The Government 

has also considered the impact of the importation of some food items like Rice, Beans, Frozen Chicken and 

Turkeys and other food stuffs on the Nations Foreign Reserve and have banned the importation of the items 

that could be produced locally. As a result, the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources has been 

mandated to import Agricultural Equipments for supply to Local Farmers both at SUBSISTENT AND 

COMMERCIAL level to encourage them to produce enough food items for local consumption and for export to 

other African Countries. We have already started awarding new contracts for supply of the equipments to 

successful bidders.

We want you to submit to us immediately your complete company name, address, your name as President or 

Managing Director / CEO of the company, your banking particulars:- (banks name address, telephone,
fax and telex numbers. Your receiving number, swift and routing numbers), with these informations, we can get 

you properly registered as one of the contractors of FMANR who has already been awarded part of this 

contract for the sum of US$113.4 Million to supply some of the Agricultural Equipments parts of which we 

already have in our custody (stores).

After receiving the above needed and stated information from you, we will process all the documentation and 

submit them for immediate approvals and the Federal Government will pay 25% of US$113.4 Million into your 

nominated bank account in the name of your company as the beneficiary, which is US$28.35M . In no time, the 

remaining US$85,050,000.00 Million shall be paid as balance payment or we together in agreement as partners 

will use another foreign firm's name that will carry out the supply of the remaining equipments as a 

sub-contractor to you in our documentation to receive this balance payment.

We shall come to your country immediately this fund is in your account to share the US$28.35 Million. The 

sharing pattern should be negotiated by both parties concerned.

However, be rest assured that no risk is involved or any scandal in the future, for we have done all our 

homework very well, nobody will be hurt during and after this transaction. It may also please you to know
that all the GOODS that cover the 25% payment are on record, only us that are key members of the contract 

board committee has this knowledge and information. There is the serious need to keep this transaction
secret and very confidential. To that effect, I would require your private phone and fax numbers for easy and 

confidential communication. I await  your immediate response to this Proposal. Meanwhile, I look forward to 

establishing life long business relationship with you.

The  nature of your company or business does not necessarily have to be Agriculturally related but ownership of 

a company is a criterium for the project.

Please reply immediately through this fax number 234-9-2726567. As soon as I receive your fax, I will call you 

on phone for detailed discussion.

Best regards,
Engr. Ugo Nzego.

Dr. Bernard Makelele
 Pretoria, South Africa.
 
 Sir,
 
 On behalf of my colleagues and I, I write this letter with great pleasure. =
Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export =
Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black
 Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the =
United States during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign =
investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in =
execution of a business transaction hereunder for the benefit of all parties.=

 
 Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of =
Project Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have =
in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.
 
 The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed =
on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the =
officials
 over-invoiced to the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Five =
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has =
been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.
 
 The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private =
investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the =
real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has =
continued to encourage
 investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere =
determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to =
continue to enjoy close relationship, and a mutually beneficial co-operation =
with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result =
we included our bills for approvals with the
 co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve =
Bank of South Africa (RBSA).
 We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, =
since we are not allowed to operate a foreign account. The changing of =
beneficiary\'s information/details and other forms of
 documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and =
its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your good self.
 I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you =
be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will =
be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10% =
shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses =
so incurred.
 It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the =
nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major =
contract and subcontracted it to other companies.
 More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win =
major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.
 
 This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost =
confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the =
successful
 execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my =
confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.
 Kindly notify me by email for further details, upon your acceptance of this =
proposal.
 
 Regards,
 
 Dr. Benard Makelele.

              {URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL}
     (RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
    {ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS)

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 126,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and Twenty six million United States
Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to
quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable and fit to provide either an existing
bank account or to set up a new  Bank a/c immediately
to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to
receive this money, as long as you will remain honest
to me till the end for this important
business trusting in you and believing  in God that
you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Chiedo Jonathan, the Auditor General of a bank in
Africa, during the course of our auditing I discovered
a floating fund  in an account opened in the bank in
1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this
account again, after going through some old files in
the records I discovered that the owner of the account
died without a [heir]  hence  the money is floating
and  if I do not remit this money out urgently it will
be forfeited for nothing. the owner
of this account is  Mr. Phillip Morris, a foreigner,
and a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993. and  no other
person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that Phillip
Morris until his death was the manager Morris & Morris
Coy.(pty). SA.


We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account,

The amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and
Twenty Six million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty Six million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as a
foreigner because this money can not be approved to a
local person here, without valid nternational
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Phillip
Morris  is a foreigner too, [and the money can only be
approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together I got your contact address  from the Girl who
operates computer, I am revealing this to you with
believe in God that you will never let me down in this
business, you are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you are
capable  and will meet up with instruction of a key
bank official who is deeply involved with me in this
business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries
and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email

You should try to call me on my satelite phone no.
882-1646685262. if you are calling my No. dial the way
you use to call other countries,  do not put South
African area code, because it is a satellite phone.

Sincerely,

Chiedo Jonathan.

DR. WILLIAMS BANIGO
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT,
LAGOS, NIGERIA
Email:  banigo@caramail.com

             URGENT   &   CONFIDENTIAL
Best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly through my 
proposal as contained in this letter.Before going into details of my proposal to you, 
I must first solicit you to treat it with  utmost confidentiality, as this is required for 
its success.

My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of Nigerias 
Contracts Review Panel who are interested in diverting some funds that are 
presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of Nigeria.In order to 
commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance to enable us transfer 
into your account the said floating funds. We are determined to conclude the 
transfer before the end of this financial quarter.

The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime, government 
officials awarded contracts that were grossly over-invoiced to Contractors.The 
present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which has the 
mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the decree 
setting up the panel,  to review these contracts and if necessary pay those who 
are being owed outstanding amounts.

My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which are 
presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for disbursement and would 
like to divert some of it for our own purposes. However, by virtue of our positions 
as civil servants and  members of this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our 
names or in the names of companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore 
been mandated, as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a 
reliable overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of 
U.S.$16,500,000.00(sixteen Million,five hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars). That is 
why I am writing you this letter.

We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account,
if you agree with our proposition as follows;

(i) 10% to the account owner (you).

(ii) 80% for us (the panel officials).

(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us )incidental to the 
actualisation of this project.

We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stock 
markets and other business till we are ready and able to have access to them. 
Please note that this transactionis 100% safe and risk-free.We intend to effect 
the transfer within a few days from the date of receipt of the following information:

Your name, companys name, address and telephone and fax numbers, and your 
banking information. The above information will enable us write letters of claim 
andjob description respectively. This way, we will use your companys name to 
apply for the payment and backdate the  award of the contract to your company.

We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit for your 
utmost confidentiality in this transaction. Please acknowledge the receipt of this 
letter and, I will bring you into a more detailed
picture of this transaction when I hear from you.

Best regards,
Dr. Williams Banigo

16 Kingsway Road 
Ikoyi,Lagos. 
Internet Fax:1 309 216 0222 

 
            PLEASE I REQUEST FOR YOUR GENUINE ASSISTANCE

I want to first solicit your confidence in this transaction. This is by
virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. We
shall be counting on your ability and reliability to prosecute a
transaction of great magnitude involving a pending business transaction
requiring maximum confidence. 

We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel who
are interested in importation of goods into our country with funds which
are presently trapped in Nigeria. In order to commence this business we
solicit our assistance to enable us RECEIVE the said trapped funds ABROAD. 

The source of this fund is as follows : During the regime of our late
head of state, Gen. Sani Abacha,the government Officials set up companies 
and awarded themselves contracts which were grossly over-invoiced in
various Ministries. The NEW CIVILIAN Government set up a Contract Review
Panel (C.R.P) and we have identified a lot of inflated contract funds
which are presently floating in the Bank. 

However, due to our position as civil servants and members of this
panel,we cannot acquire this money in our names.

I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues of 
the panel to look for an Overseas partner INTO whose ACCOUNT the sum of
US$15,600,000.00(Fifteen Million Six Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars) WILL BE PAID BY TELEGRAPHIC TRANSFER. Hence we are writing you
this letter. 

We have agreed to share the money thus: 

70% for us (the officials)

20% for the FOREIGN PARTNER (you) 

10% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses. 


It is from this 70% that we wish to commence the importation
business.Please note that this transaction is 100% safe in all it's
ramifications and we hope that the funds arrive your account in latest
ten (10) banking days from the date of reciept of the following
information by email: A suitable name and bank account into which the
funds can be paid. Your confidential telephone and fax numbers for essay
communication. 

The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job
description respectively. This way we will use your company's name to
apply for payments and re-award the contract in your name/company name.We 
are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your
confidentiality in this transaction. 

For security reasons and in order to move forward quickly,please respond
to me by Tel:234 1 776 0870,Internet Fax:1 309 216 0222,so I can bring
you into the complete picture of this pending project and provide more
information as to the succcessful conclusion of this project. The best
response however,would be by telephone, so we can discuss fully all
issues needed to complete this venture in good time,and successfully.

Thank you and God bless. 

Yours Faithfully
Dr. Israel Junaid

From: Mr. Charles Nwodo
Universal Trust Bank.website:www.utbplc.com
Dear friend,
This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. The message could be strange but real if you pay some attention to it.
 I could have notified you about it at least for the sake of your integrity. Please accept my sincere apologies. In writing you this message, I have to say that
 I have no intentions of causing you any embarrassment. 
 I am Mr. Charles Nwodo Manager with Universal Trust Bank  Plc. of Nigeria, Island Branch. I managed to get your contact details through the Internet myself.
 Time is of the importance and I am desperately looking for a person to assist me in this confidential business. A British oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian
 National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Claude Brian Best made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit on January 6, 1999, valued at US$2,500,000.00 (Two Million Five 
Hundred Thousand US Dollars), for twelve (12) calendar months in my branch. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.
  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Claude Brian Best died 
in an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless.
 I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Claude Brian Best did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank
 Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$2,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.
 No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 4 (four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government
 if nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Claude Brian Best so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into
 the hands of some corrupt government officials.  This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary 
documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.  We shall employ the service of two lawyers for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the 
necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.  A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer
 of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.  The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.

Good Day,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation. 

My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!
nd) to seek for political asylum.

I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. 

President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.

Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. 

I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 

Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

corrupt officials=2E

This is simple=2C I will like you to provide me immediately with the following=3B your full names=2C date

in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you=2E There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for

documents that will help you understand=2E Please observe utmost confidentiality=2C and rest assured that this

FROM: MR WILLIAMS DANIEL

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO.

REPLY TO EMAIL ADDRESS:   williamsd3@rediffmail.com

Dear Friend,
 
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so
informal a manner. This is necessitated by my urgent
need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and
unsolicited but I will crave your indulgence and pray
that you view it seriously. My name is MR Williams Daniel of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the
close aides to the former President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed
memory, may his soul rest in peace.
 
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my
colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the rebel
group. But when President Kabila was killed in a
bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We immediately 
decided to divert the fund into a private security
company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security
of the said amount is presently being threatened here
following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col.
Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila)
a tribesman, and some other Military Personnel from
our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent
Kabila, Joseph Kabila. 
In view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy
foreign partner who can assist us to move this money
out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under
Diplomatic Cover to a security company in the europe
in your name. This is to ensure that the Diplomatic
Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not
pass through normal custom/airport screening and
clearance.
Our inability to move this money out of Congo all
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed
good friends (western countries) who suddenly became
hostile to those of us who worked with the late
President Kabila, immediately after his son took
office. Though we have neither seen nor met each
other, the information We gathered from an associate
who has worked in your country has encouraged and
convinced us that with your sincere assistance, this
transaction will be properly handled with modesty
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The
said money is a state fund and therefore requires a
total confidentiality.
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email
address above with your telephone, fax number and
personal information to enable us discuss the
modalities and what will be your share
(percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You
to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this Matter
extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your Decision,
while I await your prompt response. Thank you and
GodBless.
 
Best Regards
MR WILLIAMS DANIEL

  {URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL}
(RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
{ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS)

Dear Sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 126,000.000.00USD) One hundred and Twenty 
six million United States Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you 
to quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set 
up a new  Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can 
serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till 
the end for this important business trusting in you and believing  in God 
that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr.Eze Ekeyion, the Auditor General of a bank in Africa, during the 
course of our auditing  I discovered a floating fund  in an account opened 
in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account 
again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that 
the owner of the account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is 
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner of this account is  Mr. 
Phillip Morris, a foreigner, and a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993, and  
no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the 
account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well 
that Phillip Morris until his death was the manager Morris & Morris 
Coy.(pty). SA.


We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six million [$26,000.000] upon 
successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall 
re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account.

The amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and Twenty Six million United 
States Dollars, only I want to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty Six 
million United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I 
am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved 
to a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid 
international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money 
is in US Dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Phillip Morris is a 
foreigner too, [and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together I got your 
contact address  from the Girl who operates computer, I am revealing this to 
you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, 
you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this 
business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step 
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number including 
the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding 
agreement that will  bind us together  before transferring the money to any 
account of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before we fly to your 
country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine, because the management 
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct 
information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive 
response and once I am convinced that you are  capable  and will meet up 
with instruction of  a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in 
this business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank official we can transfer this 
money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with 
assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in 
your country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all documents of 
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place 
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to discuss with me face 
to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and three 
of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going 
into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that 
you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my 
position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from  the 
relevant  ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total 
amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might 
have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email address.

You should try to call me on my satelite phone no. 882-1646685262. if you 
are calling my No. dial the way you use to call other countries, do not put 
South African area code, because it is a satellite phone.


Sincerely,

Eze Ekeyion.

Good Day,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this contact might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation. 

My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!
nd) to seek for political asylum.

I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. 

President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.

Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf to clear the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. 

I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 

Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your part.

and payment approvals. I came to know of you in my 
search for a reliable person to handle a very 
confidential transaction that involves the transfer of 
a huge sum of money to a foreign account. It may sound 
strange but exercise patience and read on. There were 
series of contracts executed by a consortium 
Multinational in the Oil industry in favor of Ministry

for crude oil, Down stream products distribution and 
subsequent evacuation- US$ 195 Million. 

2. Contract for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of 
the various refineries in the country~ US$ 152Million. 


3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum 
products (Depots) US$240 Million. The original values 
of this contract were deliberately over invoiced to 
the sum of US $35.5million American Dollars which has 
now been approved and is now ready to be transferred 
being that the companies that actually executed these 
contracts has been fully paid and project officially 
commissioned. consequently, my colleagues and I are 
willing to transfer the total amount to your account

have agreed to offer you 30% of the transferred sum 
while 10% shall be set aside for accidental expenses 
(Internal & External) between the parties in the 
course of the transfer. We will mandate you to draw up 
an investment plan for us of which you will control 
since we cannot bring our shares back to Nigeria. We 
are very interested in investing in real estate in 
your country. You must however note that this 
transaction is subjected to the following termsand 
conditions: 

1. Our conviction of your transparent honesty 
anddiligence.

thecircumstances we now find ourselves. 

3. That the funds would be transferred to an account

at the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate 
transfer of the funds within 14 working days, subject 
to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our 
assurance is that your role is 100% risk free. To

beneficiary. Also, be informed that our main reason of

ATTN:SIR, 

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE- STRICTLYCONFIDENTIAL 

I am Dr SOLOMON AZEEZ, an accountant in the Ministry 
of petroleum Resources (MPR) and a member of a 
three-man Tender Board in charge of contract review 
and payment approvals. I came to know of you in my 
search for a reliable person to handle a very 
confidential transaction that involves the transfer of 
a huge sum of money to a foreign account. It may sound 
strange but exercise patience and read on. There were 
series of contracts executed by a consortium 
Multinational in the Oil industry in favor of Ministry 
of Petroleum Resources among which were: 

1. The extension of pipeline network within Nigeria 
for crude oil, Down stream products distribution and 
subsequent evacuation- US$ 195 Million. 

2. Contract for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of 
the various refineries in the country~ US$ 152Million. 


3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum 
products (Depots) US$240 Million. The original values 
of this contract were deliberately over invoiced to 
the sum of US $35.5million American Dollars which has 
now been approved and is now ready to be transferred 
being that the companies that actually executed these 
contracts has been fully paid and project officially 
commissioned. consequently, my colleagues and I are 
willing to transfer the total amount to your account 
for subsequent disbursement since we are Civil Servant 
and are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau 
(Civil Servant Laws) from opening operating foreign 
account in our names. Needless to say, the trust posed 
on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we 
have agreed to offer you 30% of the transferred sum 
while 10% shall be set aside for accidental expenses 
(Internal & External) between the parties in the 
course of the transfer. We will mandate you to draw up 
an investment plan for us of which you will control 
since we cannot bring our shares back to Nigeria. We 
are very interested in investing in real estate in 
your country. You must however note that this 
transaction is subjected to the following termsand 
conditions: 

1. Our conviction of your transparent honesty 
anddiligence. 

2. That you would treat this transaction with utmost 
secrecy and confidentiality because of 
thecircumstances we now find ourselves. 

3. That the funds would be transferred to an account 
over which you have absolute control. Modalities have 
been worked out at the highest level of the presidency 
at the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate 
transfer of the funds within 14 working days, subject 
to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our 
assurance is that your role is 100% risk free. To

 URGENT BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP

 ATTENTION:PRESIDENT/C.E.O

      Dear Sir, My name is MR TUNDA USENI the eldest son of Rtd General
 JEREMAIAH. J. T. USENI who was the est. while Minister of the Federal
 Capital territory Abuja in the late General Sani Abacha\\\'s Regime of
 1993-
 1998. I am contacting you in a benevolent spirit; utmost confidence and
 trust to enable us provide a solution to a money transfer of $60M that is
 presently putting my entire family into great disarray. You may be quite
 surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not despair, I got your
 contact from a business site on the internet and following the
 information I gathered about you, I was convinced that you could be of
 assistance to me. So, decided to contact you at once due to the urgency
 required for us to immediately transfer the said funds out of the
 country. During the time my father was in the government with the late
 General Sani Abacha as the head of state, they were both involved in
 several deals that yielded Billions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the
 deals was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the importation
 of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the Nigerian Defense, funds set to
 embark on an oversea campaign to counter the United States action to put
 a stop to the self succession bid of the Abacha\\\\\\\'s government to
 retain
 power, and monies set aside to rehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum
 Refineries and the National Electric Power Authority which supplies
 Electricity to the entire nation. If you are conversant with world news,
 you would understand better. During this period my father was able to
 make some good money for himself and kept in his private bank accounts.
 The then head of state General Sani Abacha transferred his share of the
 money through a Lebanese businessman, Chagoury and a Jewish businessman,
 Mark Rissar to bank accounts overseas. Unfortunately, all the secrets
 were revealed by the investigation agencies set up by the successive
 governments and most of the Abacha\\\\\\\'s loots were traced and
 repatriated
 from the various accounts to the Federal Government Treasury. Out of the
 money my father made, he left the sum of N50 Million (Fifty Million
 Naira) in the CBN escrow account for further transfer into a foreign
 account and a sum of $60M (Sixty Million Dollars) was kept in a Private
 security firm here in Nigeria. Through the confessions made by the
 Abacha\\\'s Family, the N50 Million was recovered by the investigating
 agency from the CBN escrow account. But were unable to discover the $60M,
 which he kept in the vaults. The reason is because no names were used to
 lodge in the funds. Instead, he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS
 (PIN) and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and Treasury Bills. Also
 the firm issued him with a certificate of deposit of the consignments.
 Note that I have these information in my custody. Right now, my father
 has been arrested and detained for interrogation. As the eldest son of my
 Father, I believe that I owe the entire family an obligation to ensure
 that the $60M is successfully transferred abroad for investment purposes.
 With the present situation, I cannot do it all by myself. It is based on
 this that I am making this contact with you. I have done a thorough
 homework and fine-tuned the best way to create you as the beneficiary to
 the funds and effect the transfer accordingly. Is rest assured that the
 modalities I have resolved to finalize the entire project guarantees our
 safety and the successful transfer of the funds. So, you will be
 absolutely right when you say that this project is risk free and viable.
 If you are capable and willing to assist, contact me at once via email
 for more details. Believe me, there is no one else we can trust again.
 All my fathers\\\' friends have deserted us after exploiting us on the
 pretence of trying to help my father. As it is said, \\\"it is at the time
 of problems that you know your true friends\\\". So long as you keep
 everything to yourself, we would definitely have no problems. For your
 assistance, I am ready to give you as much as 20% of the total funds
 after transfer and invest a reasonable percentage into any viable
 business you may suggest. Please, I need your assistance to make this
 happen and please; do not undermine it because it will also be a source
 of up liftment to you also. You have absolutely nothing to loose in
 assisting us instead, you have so much to gain. Awaiting your urgent and
 positive response.

 BEST REGARDS,


 MR TUNDA USENI

       {URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL}
(RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
{ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS)

Dear sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 126,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and Twenty six million United States
Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to
quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable and fit to provide either an existing
bank account or to set up a new  Bank a/c
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c
can serve to receive this money, as long as you will
remain honest to me till the end for this important
business trusting in you and believing  in God that
you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr.JOHN CHOMA,the Auditor General of a bank
in Africa, during the course of our auditing  I
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner
of this account is  Mr. Phillip Morris, a
foreigner, and a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993.
and  no other person knows about this account or any
thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Phillip Morris until his death was the manager
Morris & Morris Coy.(pty). SA.


We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six
million [$26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account,

The amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and
Twenty Six million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty Six million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Phillip
Morris is a foreigner too, [and the money can only
be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together I got your contact address  from the Girl
who operates computer, I am revealing this to you
with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business, you are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you
are  capable  and will meet up with instruction of  a
key bank official who is deeply involved with me in
this business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries
and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

You should try to call me on my satelite phone no.
882-1646685262. if you are calling my No. dial the way
you use to call other countries, do not put South
African area code, because it is a satellite phone.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my
private email address:<JOCHOM1@HOTMAIL.COM>

Sincerely,

JOHN CHOMA.

DR. WILLIAMS BANIGO
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT,
LAGOS, NIGERIA


             URGENT   &   CONFIDENTIAL
Best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly
through my proposal as contained in this letter.Before going into details 
of my proposal to you, I must first solicit you to treat it with  utmost
confidentiality, as this is required for its success.

My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of
Nigerias Contracts Review Panel who are interested in diverting some
funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of
Nigeria.In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your
assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said floating
funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this
financial quarter.

The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime,
government officials awarded contracts that were grossly over-invoiced to 
Contractors.The present civilian government set up the Contract Review
Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made
available to it by the decree setting up the panel,  to review these
contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.

My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which 
are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for
disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes.
However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and  members of
this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of
companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a 
matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable
overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of
U.S.$16,500,000.00(sixteen Million,five hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars).
That is why I am writing you this letter.

We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account,
if you agree with our proposition as follows;

(i) 10% to the account owner (you).

(ii) 80% for us (the panel officials).

(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us
)incidental to the actualisation of this project.

We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign
stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have
access to them. Please note that this transactionis 100% safe and
risk-free.We intend to effect the transfer within a few days from the
date of receipt of the following information:

Your name, companys name, address and telephone and fax numbers, and
your banking information. The above information will enable us write
letters of claim andjob description respectively. This way, we will use
your companys name to apply for the payment and backdate the  award of
the contract to your company.

We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit
for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. Please acknowledge
the receipt of this letter and, I will bring you into a more detailed
picture of this transaction when I hear from you.

Best regards,
Dr. Williams Banigo

 contract and subcontracted it to other companies=2E

With due respect trust and humility, I write you this proposal, which I 
believe it will be a great interstto you.I found your contact while I 
was doing aprivate research on the internet for a reliable and capable 
foreign partner that will assist my family and me. That's why I 
contacted you. I am MRS.BRIDGET LUZA the wife of MR.MORRIS LUZA of 
Zimbabwe.During the current war against famers in Zimbabwe and from the 
support of our president ROBERT MUGABE to claim all the white owned 
farms in our country, all the white and black farmers were ordered to 
surrender their farms to his party members and his followers. My husband 
who was one of the best farmers in our country and treasurer of the 
farmer's CO-pperation did not suport his idea and so the party members 
invaded my husband's farms and burnt everything in the farm, Killed my 
husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband's farm. After the 
death of my husband, i and my childern decided to move out of zimbabwe 
because our lives were in danger with the money that my husband kept in 
his hidden safe in my house. The amount contained in the safe is US$11M 
(ELEVEN MILLION US DOLLAR) and we decided to move the money to the 
Republic of REPUBLIC OF GHANA. where we deposited the money with SECURITY 
COMPANY as a valuable item.So i decided to contact you to assist me to

MRS ELISABETH LAMINE
ABIDJAN - COTE D'IVOIRE
PHONE: 00225 07 93 44 19

Dear sir

I wish to solicit your help in migrating to your
country and investing my funds.
Briefly, I am a Sierra Leonean National and the wife
of late Dr SIMON LAMINE.
Until his death, my husband was the General overseer
of the Diamond and Gold Mining Corporation in Kanema,
Sierra Leone. On April 6 2000 the military forces
loyal to the Government of Ahmed TIJAN KABBAH invaded
the Diamond and Gold mine and assassinated my husband,
mistaking him for his brother MIKE LAMINE who is the
deputy to the leader of the revolutionary United
Front (RUF ) FODAY SANKOH.

When the news reached me, I hurried gathered some
valuables in our family villa and escaped for my dear
life in the company of my only son PETERS.

Among the valuables was a file that contained details
of a Deposit my husband made in a security company in
Europe. He deposited US$ 15.5 M  contained
in 1 Trunk Box in the name of our son PETERS as
containing family valuables. He did not disclose the
real contents of the box to the security company.
Rather, he declared the deposit as Family Valuables
for security reasons. This is the money he made from
the sale of Gold and diamonds during his time as the
General overseer.
We need your sincere assistance to move this funds out from the 
security
company IN EUROPE for investment
in your country as we cannot invest here due to its
nearess to our country and the war still going on
there. Besides, our Refugee Status here cannot help
matters for us. We also ask you to scout for a viable
and lucrative business, so that we can invest wisely.

We have it in mind to give your 30 % of the total sum
(15.5 million US Dollars), and 20% share in any
investment we will embark upon if you assist us. We
will also set aside 5% of the funds for ancillary
expenses which you will make in course of this
transaction- air tickets and handling expenses etc.

This fortune we have revealed to you should remain
confidential as it only you who we have told about it.
pleaselet me have your phone/fax numbers for more detials.

Note that this transaction is risk free.
May God Bless you as you assist us.
Yours Sincerely ,

MRS ELISABETH / PETERS LAMINE

Dear sir,

Greetings to you and yourfamily. I will need your assistance in investing in 
your country. Real Estate and importation into my country. But due to my 
position as a civil servant I will need someone to assist me with this as my 
job right now will conflict with my investment plans. 

If you are sure you can be of assistance to me please send me your 
confidential and direct email address, telephone and fax numbers so that
I can 
intimate you further on this transaction. I need someone that is trust
worthy. 
If you know you cannot be trusted please donot reply to my mail. But if
you are 
absolutely sure we can work together, then I promise you a handsome
reward and 
this will be detailed to you confidentially and an agreement will be
reached by 
both parties. i.e you and me. 

I will like you to please keep this transaction absolutely confidential
as I am 
a top government fuctunary in my country and we are not allowed to
transact any 
foreign transaction as long as we are still in active government service. 

Please reply to my mail immediately. 

Regards, 
Mr.solo chuks.

Re: Urgent Assistance Needed

By way of introduction I am Eng. Farouk Al-Bashar, I represent my family as the oldest son of the Al-Bashar family, who are the descendants of Ibrahim Al-Bashar Ali from one of the oil rich areas in Iraq. Over the years my family has acquired huge sums of money from royalties for the exploration of oil in our region but over the past 15 years, Saddam Hussein and his gangs of bandits have taken our oils without payments and we can not complain as those who did are all dead. In the wake of the Gulf War of 1990, our family withdrew most moneys that remain in coded bank accounts that Saddam did not find and we hide it in a secret chamber underground, where it remained safe until after the war. At the end of Gulf war, we moved the funds into a private vault of a security company in Baghdad, where it was until we collected it a few days ago on the fear of the eminent war with America.

We pray they remove Saddam as he is the cause of much hardship here, but our funds are trapped here and there is no avenue to transfer any amount from Iraq without Saddam knowing. The problem now is how do we transfer the funds totalling US$12.5 Million in cash from here.

We are afraid that with the capacity of the bombs America is coming to Baghdad with nowhere would be safe for the money, so we need you to help in securing a private collection agency who would come to Iraq and collect the money and have them moved to the west, where our family is planning to relocate to as life in Iraq is no longer worth living because of Saddam.

I have to travel lots of miles each day to send an email hoping someone out there would assist this family, if you can we will give you the details of an agency that can lift the funds from here as given to me by a US Marine. The private collection agency would then collect the fund from here and deliver it to you for safe keep. Hoping the American campaign would be successful, we would then come over to your country
for a meeting to share the funds and hopefully start a new life with you as a partner.

For your assistance with this project the family is willing to give you 10% of the funds, however if this does not suit you we are open for negotiation.

We eagerly await your response so we can inform you of the next line of action.

Regards.

Eng. Farouk Al- Bashar
For the entire Al-Bashar family

                   INVESTMENT OFFER
         
Dear Sir,
In appreciation of your esteemed contact received
through a reliable source and the choice of your
country I wish to introduce myself, I am Mr.James
Kabila the son of the late Democratic Republic of
Congo President Laurent Desire Kabila of the blessed
memory.I know this letter might come to you as a
surprise butI honestly do not intend to surprise you.
I write this letter in respect of my intention to
invest the sum of US$35M(Thirty Five Million United
State Dollars) with you.I inherited this money from my
mother. This money was got through the smuggling and
sales of Diamond and Timber when my father was the
head of state. My mother though not her legal wife
used her privilege position to engage in the business
of Diamond and Timber since she knows that her
survival will depend on how much she can get out of
the privilege situation.   When my father was
assassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his bodyguards
Lt. Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some
top army officers that wanted to topple him. I escaped
to Madrid, Spain because of the fear that I might be
arrested by my half brother Lt.General Joseph Kabila
the present head of state.Actually his mother and my
mother are not in the best of relationship because of
who among them will be the first lady tussle and this
ultimately affected us their children.My mother
advised me to leave For Madrid, Spain where these
funds were deposited for safe keeping with a Private
Security Company here in Spain.On getting to  Spain
where I have been living since then as a political
refugee, I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can
come down to Madrid, Spain for a meeting and to clear
the funds in his name as the sole beneficiary of the
Consignment as I was afraid of being defraud. Honestly
I contacted you because I don't want to invest this
money in Madrid Spain due to my status here as a
political Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to
take risk because this money is all that my Mother and
I are depending on. My step brother Joseph,who is now
the present leader of my country has seized all my
father's assets and money. He left us empty handed
without knowing about this funds deposited with the
Security Company here. That is why I decided that
investing this money abroad should be the best
investment for me. I will be honored if I can be given
the privilege of investing this money with you. I
expect you to be trust worthy and kind enough to
respond to this distress call to save My Mother and I
from a hopeless future. And if you agree, I hereby
agree to compensate your sincere and candid effort in
this regard with 15% of the total amount of 
$35million US Dollars. When the money ($35 million) is
moved into your discrete account. You will be allowed
to draw 15% in your favor, while the remaining 85%
will be invested meaning fully for our future if
possible in your area of business and different
sectors of the Economy in your country which are
dividends yielding.Whatever your decision is please
reach me immediately,and keep this letter tight secret
for the interest of my Family.
Best regards, 
Mr.James Kabila.

DAYO NAPS
234 80 372 20807

Dear Sir,

I am Mr. Dayo Naps, an official with one of the APEX banks in Nigeria.My colleagues and I have an urgent and very confidential 
business proposal for you. On the 6th of June 1998 an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with us and
his present balance is valued at US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
 Dollars Only) in my Bank. We sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we
sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his employers that he died from an automobile accident. On further
investigation, we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was
fruitless, as he had none. We therefore made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not 
declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still 
lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it is now, no one 
will ever come forward to claim this money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money 
will revert to the ownership of the Government if unclaimed. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. This is simple; all 
we need is some of your details so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which would
put you in place as Mr. Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services of an accredited Attorney for the drafting
and notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of probate/administration in your 
favour for the transfer. The money would be shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you.

There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as a manager 
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately via email.

Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for us. I shall 
still require your assistance to invest my own share in your country just incase you can help, otherwise we'll take our 
share . 

Awaiting your urgent reply.

Mr.Dayo Naps

Your strictest confidentiality and kind consideration highly required.

Greetings to you,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or surprising this letter might seem to you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration of its importance and immense benefit. Also I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity.

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your indulgence to read this carefully, and have a general overview of my situation. 

My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with government forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holla!
 nd) to 
seek for political asylum.

I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a private safe deposit security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the consignment containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time now for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit with the Security Company here in Amsterdam. 

President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.

Your role in this project, is acting on my behalf as a trustee to claim the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, after which, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction.  My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15 %($2,775,000) of the money. 

I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit for the safety deposit, which is in my name, and will be used for claim from the security company, and the release codes of the vaults. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response.

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 

Please contact me on my private email address; olivsav@netscape.net  whether or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part.

Good Day,

With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally. However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.

My name is Mr.Mako Okere, the first son of Iko Okere,one of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict, I decided to contact you through email, after searching for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons. However,I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.

The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a business venture. Due to the the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my father forsaw the danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business foreign accounts in 
dollars and sold up our shares in major companies. We then went to Johannesburg, South Africa to deposit the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This money was deposited with this Private Security company for safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in Botswana and Swaziland.

President Mugabe's support for the violent imbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe to South Africa where I was arrested and detained for eight(8 good month)in jail.I fled south Africa for The Netherlands with the help of the present prison command chief officer in Charge(P.C.C.O)

I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, and they have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg here. I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part of the money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial ransaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can be transferred, ence this proposal to you.You have to understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist with the arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Afri!
 ca to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you representing me.

For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your assistance, and helping me open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply.

I have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4% ($580,000,00) for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 10% for assisting with opening an account, then 85%will be left in the account here for me.

Please, I want you to maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you inadvance as I anticipate your co-operation.

Thanks and God bless.

Sincerely,
Mako Okere

This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the
fact that we have not met.The message could be strange but real if you 
pay some attention to it.
Please accept my sincere apologies.In bringing this message of goodwill 
to you, I have to say that I have no intention of causing you any pains.

My name is SENATOR GBENGA ALUKO, the executive
Chairman Pension funds committee in the senate
of the federal Republic Of Nigeria. I am writing you 
to earnestly Solicit your assistance in helping to
receive some sum of money. I got your e-mail address on
the Internet while searching for a reliable and reputable
person to handle this transaction.

THE PROPOSITION: 
We have the sum of US$9,000,000.00 (Nine Million
Dollars) that we intend to transfer overseas through the assistance of
a foreign partner.This money came as a result of the 
unclaimed pension funds belonging to a British expatriate petroleum 
engineer with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,Engr.John 
Bruno.
After all other pensioners have been paid their entitlements,
we deposited this unclaimed sum of US$9,000,000.00,with the Debt 
Reconciliation Committee. 

In a bid to make sure Engr.John Bruno gets his due,I sent a routine 
notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month,
we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, 
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Engr.John Bruno died,
from an automobile accident.On further investigation, I found out that
he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of
kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Engr.John Bruno did not declare any kin or relations in all his 
official documents.This sum of US$9,000,000.00 is still sitting in an
account of the Debt Reconciliation Committee and the interest is being 
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.No one will 
ever come forward to claim it. 
According to Nigerian Law,at the expiration of 2 (two) years,the money 
will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody 
applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner
to stand in as the next of kin to Engr.John Bruno so that the 
fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the hands of some 
corrupt government officials.This is simple, I will like you to provide
immediately your full names,address,telephone and fax numbers so

Dear friend,
  31-612-696-672
I am Domas k, yankThe son of former minister of finance (Domas Makabo) of the Republic of Sierra-Leone West Africa based on the information I gathered from your chamber of commerce and industry on your credibility, I decide to contact for the assistance.
Regarding my zeal toward foreign investment and security for my life and possession, I therefore write to you a break down of this proposal.
My father died when a group of rebel soldier led by Sir Foday Sankoh
overthrown Government of sierra-Leone forcing the president out of power and killing many members of the cabinet and minister including my own father. When it become apparently obvious that the country no longer safe for the citizens due to the political war and massive killing and destruction of properties, I decided to move to Holland with a treasure containing the sum of US$12.500.000.00(twelve million five hundred thousand united state dollars) through a diplomatic means, this fund is the last tangible money my father left behind before his death.

The said amount is presently in Holland (The Netherlands) where I am
currently seeking political asylum. While the consignment containing the fund is in the custody of the diplomatic courier company they are not aware of the content as it was deposited as personal effect and artifact. I am seeking for partner who will serve as a the guardian of this fund with whom I could plan the best way to move this money out of Holland for investment which is my main purpose of contacting you.
Thus I decided to offer you 20% of the total money for assisting me to
actualize this project while 10% of the money has been set aside to offset any incidental expenses that might incurred during the course of this funds and the balance 70%shall be for me and my family which shall be invested in your country. And are will visit you country soonest in order to inquire areas of possible business investment. I shall be sincerely glad if my request is rendered.
Thank you
God bless you

Domas k. yank

Good day, 

This email message requires your utmost confidentiality. 

It is with warm heart I am offering you my friendship, and I hope this mail meets you in good time. I know this is a most unusual way to contact you as we have not met personally or had any dealings in the past, but I am humbly asking that you take due consideration of the importance of my proposal and the immense benefit in it for you. Also I duly apologize for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of integrity. 

First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total Independence of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet directory, in my intensive and desperate search for a partner, hence this email to you. I crave your indulgence to read this carefully, in order to have a general overview of my situation. 

My Uncle was killed in a surprise attack by government troops of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried UNITA with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for leadership. Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose Dembo and assume leadership in order to enrich themselves and some of them who saw me as a threat to their ambitions, including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become uncontrollable when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my Uncle who is my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle interested me anymore, as there was no more sense of direction. I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in the war. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came her!
 e 
(Holland) to seek for political asylum. 

I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your most needed assistance in respect to safekeeping of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales. This money (US$18.5million), which was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss Bank account, through the Diplomatic means we use to move money abroad, and was on transit with a Private Security company here in Amsterdam, Holland in February last year when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. I then instructed the company to secure the safety deposit containing the money pending on further instructions from me. I have waited all this time for security reasons, and have now decided to act with your reliable assistance. As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland to seek for political asylum here, is the location of the Security Company here in Amsterdam. 

Since President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos has lobbied the International Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and he has already done this in Angola, I cannot lodge the funds in my name any where in the world at the moment. Also I did not declare the funds to the government here on arrival last year. 

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you understand that this kind of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act of desperation on my part in order not to lose this money. Please ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy. 

Your role in this project, is to act on my behalf as a trustee to claim the safety deposit containing the money which is deposited in my name, from the Security company, since I can not participate in any business activity or open a bank account here as a political asylum seeker. 

After the safety deposit is claimed, the money will lodged into an account preferably a new account you should open for this transaction. My share of the money will be returned to me when my asylum application in this country is granted, and I have permission to do business and open an account here. 

For your reliable assistance, I will reward you with 15 %($2,775,000) of the money. 

I have with me, the Certificate of Deposit and the release codes of the vaults for the safety deposit, which is in my name, and will be used for claim from the security company. Also, everything will be legally processed for transfer of ownership to you. This transaction should be completed immediately depending on your prompt response. 

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve this goal. 

Please contact me on my private email address; olivsav@netscape.net  whether or not you are interested in assisting us. This will enable us make alternative plans, in the event of non-interest on your part.

Dear sir ,

I am Mrs. Mrs. Grace Abba-Ganna, personal accountant to Late Chief Bola=20
Ige(SAN) the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of=20
Justice, who wasrecently assassinated at his country home on the 23rd=20
December, 2001 by assassins (May his gentle soul rest in peace) Amen.

Before his death,he entrusted a certificate of deposit valued=20
US$10,000,000 (United States Ten Million Dollars), with a security company =
in=20
Europe.He told me that this money was deposited for him by the Former=20

interest not to appear at the Oputa panel for re-conciliation and human=20
rights violation investigation commission headed by Rtd. Justice Chukwudife=
=20
Oputa.

My reason of contacting you is for both of us to join heads and hands
together to make claim over the US$10,000,000, as this money was
deposited on my favour at the security company as instructed by the=20
late Attorney General, to avoid trace of his name over accepting such gift=
=20
or offer.

His intention before his death was to contact a foreign partner who is
trust worthy, capable of handling such huge amount of money and also
operate a foreign account where the money will be deposited or paid
into waiting for his retirement. The reason is because our country law
states that civil servants are not entitled to operate foreign=20
accounts.

As it is now, with your full co-operation both of us can make claim
over the US$10,000,000, what is expected of you is:

(a) Your full name and address=20
(b) Your phone and fax number
(c) Your International Passport or Drivers license and your readiness
to appear at the security company to sign off the money to your
personal account.

As soon as I confirm your interest, I will forward to you the

legal backing to make claim over the money at the security company. I=20
will also forward to you the contact particulars of the Security Company=20
and letter of agreement between both of us over the security of my fund=20
that will be in your custody.

For accepting to help out 30% of the US$10,000,000 will be for you, 60%
for me and 10% set aside for re-imbursement of expenses incurred by
both
parties during the transaction.

Awaiting your urgent response.

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL



My dear Friend, 


I am highly compelled upon strict recommendation, to write you this very 
urgent and confidential letter.I do hope my letter will not embarrass you
since I had no previous correspondence with you.I hope this mail will not 
come to you as a surprise.


I am sending this proposal with due sense of humanity, responsibility and
with few awareness that you will give it a sympathetic attention. I regree
t the inconvenience it may cause you base on the condition that we have not 
met before. 


I am Mrs. Salatu Mustapha, the wife of Al Mustapha, personal assistant to the Late head of state of Federal Republic of Nigeria - General Sani Abacha.I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to each other like wise developing a cordial relationship.


My husband along with the head of state and top officials of their past administration has been accused of looting several Billion United States 
Dollars from the Nigeria Government. The current attitude of the present government towards my family has indeed made life quite unbearable for us.


Fortunately, Al Mustapha my Husband has Six million and eight hundred thousa
nd United States Dollars(US$6.8 million) cash, which he intended to use for investment purposes overseas. This money is kept in a private security company. 


This money was deposited for safe keeping in the security vault of a freighting agency here by my husband preparotry to being air lifted abroad 
for investment purposes before his arrest leaving a clause that it could only be claimed by an expertriate partner. It is only my husband and myself that know where the money is kept. 


Due to the current situation in the country concerning governments vendettas towards my family, we seek your assistance to transfer this money out of Nigeria for the purpose of investment as intended by my husband.


Note that my family is currently being probed by this present government for alleged involvement in misappropriation of public funds during their regime.Towards this effect, an embargo restricting my family members from traveling or carrying out
financial transactions without their 
express permission is in force.


Right now, my husband (Al Mustapha) is under arrest and is being detained in
connection to the above and other activities of his late Boss.
However, I have an arrangement on how to freight this money to you after receiving some assurances from you of the safety our own share and that you 
will only take the commission that we will offer you.


This money personally belongs to my husband and he intends that it still 
be used for investment. No record ever existed concerning this money, nei
ther is the money traceable by the government because there
is no Documentation concerning the funds in the Federal Treasury. 


The freighting company to be used has now been introduced to me and as so
on as we recieve your readiness to assist us recieve this fund we shall 
formalize the deposit documents in your name and reach an agreement with
them to air lift the consignment for your pick up.


Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, we 
propose a commission of 15%(Fifteen Percent) of the total sum to you for 
the expected services and assistance. While 5% is mapped out
for miscellaneous expenses.


On your positive consent, I shall expect you to contact me urgently to 
enable us discuss about this.Your urgent response is highly needed. I must 
use this opportunity to implore you to exercise utmost indulgence to keep 
this matter extraordinarily confidential, while I await your prompt response.


Best regards,


MRS. SALATU AL MUSTAPHA

Hello,
I am sorry for the embarrassment this letter might cause you as we have not =
had any correspondence before this letter. I got your address through my =
nephew   with Nigerian Military Chamber of Commerce industry and Mining =
during my research for a reliable and trustworthy partner who l can do =
business with though l did not disclose the nature of the business l intend =
to do with whoever he recommend for me. 
I am DR. MRS MARIAM ABACHA, wife of the late Nigeria Head of State, General =
Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 while still on active duty. I =
am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance to =
each other likeness developing a cordial relationship. 
I currently have within my reach the sum of Twenty - Five Million US Dollars =
(US$25,000,000.00) cash which l intends to use for investment, like Real =
Estate Development specifically in your country. This money came as a payback =
contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countries =
Multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant. 
The Russian Partners returned my husband's Share of USD$25,000,000.00 after =
the death of my husband and Lodged in my husband's Security Company of which =
l am director right now, the new Civilian Government have intensified their =
probe on my husband? Financial and oil company. In view of these, l acted =
fast to withdraw the US$25,000,000.00 from the company vault and deposited it =
in a Security Company. I have since declared the Security Company bankrupt. =
No record ever existed concerning the money traceable by the government =
because there is no documentation showing that we received the money from the =
Russian. 
Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude =
towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of this =
money within. Let me refer you to the front page of this day newspapers of =
10th March 2001. You can check it through their website www.thisdayonline.com =
the present government in Nigeria had frozen and seized all our bank accounts =
both here in Nigeria and abroad.Thus consent l shall expect you to contact me =
urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transaction.Bearing in =
mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, I proposed a =
percentage of 30% of the total sum to you for the expected service and =
assistance, 15% for offsetting minor expenses incurred in the  course of this =
transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to stop further =
contacts. All correspondence must be by the email address =
mariamabacha200@ecplaza.net I will give you my Tel numbers where you can =
contact me when I hear from you. 
I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence =
to keep this matter extraordinarily confidential whatever your decision while =
await your prompt response. 
NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family, l has =
decided that this transaction exist between you and my nephew Dr. Azeez =
Bello. Remember to include your private Tel/fax or mobile number for easy =
communication. 
Best Regards.

Good Day,


With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope
this letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising  to you to
receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this transaction,
which I propose with my free mind and as a person of integrity.  My name
is  Owen Mubane, the first son of Mapele Mubane, of the  most popular
black farmer  from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land  dispute in my
country. As led by my instict, I decided to contact you  through email,
after searching  for contacts via the internet, as it  is the only means
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties  with Zimbabwe for
security and safety reasons.  However, I apologize  if this is not
acceptable to you.


The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in  a
business venture. Due to the land and political problems in  Zimbabwe,
as a result of President Robert Mugabe's introduction of  new Land Act
Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the  few rich black
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life,  my father for saw
the danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was  murdered, he withdrew
all of our business foreign accounts in dollars  and sold up our shares
in major companies. We then went to  SOUTH AFRICA  to deposit the sum of
US$14.5 million  (Fourteen million, Five Hundred thousand US dollars),
in a private  security company. This money was deposited with this
Private Security  company for safety and security reasons, and  was to
be used for the  purchase of land, new machines and chemicals
establishment of new  farms in Europe.


President Mugabe's support for the violent  Zimbabwean war veterans  and
some lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my beloved  father
and other innocent lives. I was continually threatened to  abandon my
inheritance from my father after he was murdered. I  resited for a
while, but when the danger became unbearable, and I  survived two murder
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe.  I am currently staying in the Netherlands
where I am seeking  political asylum. In fact my decision to come here
to seek asylum, is  because the security company from South Africa, has
a branch here,  and they have moved the deposit from their office in
Johannesburg down  here. I need to transfer this money to  an account
and invest part of  the money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a
refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any =
financial
transaction, this is why  I am seeking a genuine and reliable  partner,
whose account this money can be transferred, hence this  proposal to
you.You have to understand that this decision taken by me  entrusts my
future and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping  of this
money. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for  me, is to
assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the  security company
from their office here in The Netherlands, as it has  now been
transfered from Johannesburg, South Afri!  ca to their branch here. The
company will be legally informed of you  representing me.


For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can
choose to have 10% of the money for your assistance, and helping me
open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go  into
partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the  money
in your country. Whichever the option you want, please to  notify me in
your reply.  I have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all
kinds of  expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction,
and 4% ($580,000,00) for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 10%
for assisting with opening an account, then 85%will be left in the
account here for me.

Please, I want you maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose  of
this transaction.  I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I
thank you in  advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me
on my  direct line which is 31 617 562  914 or via email
owenmubane1000@rediffmail.com. 

 Sincerely, 

 Owen Mubane.

From:Muhammed Abacha

I wish to introduce myself to you and the reason for my reaching out to you. I am Muhammed Abacha the the son of the late military head of state General Sani Abacha who died mysteriously on the 8th of June 1998. Following the death of my father Gen. Sani Abacha,elections were successfully held in the country and a civilian administration was sworn into power with the assistance of the American Government under the leadership of President Clinton. With the advent of the new democratic administration, a decision was taken by the new president
of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo to probe and ultimately prosecute all past military officers and their cohorts that served in very strategic capacities in the last military regime of my father.I was among those singled out to to be punished after a makeshift trial,for the supposed deeds of my dad,ever since I have been in detention(the past 3 years).

On monday the 24 September 2002,I was released,on the condition that I will release the rest of my fathers money in my care,to the tune of $I.5b,which I agreed. Now I have been released but kept under severe house arrest,I had amassed monies running into hundreds of millions of dollars stashed in various private foreign accounts around the world,most of wish have been frozen. Presently, I am confined under house arrest after my recent release from detention and I am now constrained into seeking for this assistance today because I cannot afford to let this goverment know that I still have funds stashed away. Shortly, before my detention I hurriedly deposited the sum of USD35.5 m illion with a security deposit firm for safekeeping,hence my seeking your assistance to receive this fund. I have since had
this amount stashed away in a private security company in Europe. I cannot send this money to any of my Bank Account abroad or open a new account for reasons mentioned earlier.

I hereby seek your assistance in moving and securing this money in your account abroad. I will adequately compensate you with 15% of the total sum for your assistance and co-operation with me to move this fund to your account for safe keeping where I can easily utilise it. The present administration has beamed their search light on any body remotely related to me and my family and you strongly know for certain that I am under surveillance and I cannot operate any of my bank accounts any more, due to their being frozen. I intend to safeguard and invest this amount of money abroad, but with a reliable foreign business partner so that we can invest the funds in doing business in your country. 

That is why I am soliciting your assistance and cooperation as regards this business.Arrangements are being concluded with the Security Company which has branches in Europe to receive the money in cash. I cannot tell the full story of my predicament on this letter. However you can get more information by checking the following web;

http://:allafrica.com/stories/200012070247.html 
http://www.lagos-online.com/fg_details_loot_from_abacha.htm 

Please note that I have a relocation plans for me and my family immediately you have cleared and received this funds in your account.

Please indicate your willingness to assist me by sending to me the following information, your private phone and fax numbers so that I can contact you and commence the transaction in earnest. I am waiting to hear from you very soon.

Please for total confidentiality reply to orionventures@dmailman.com

Muhammed Abacha

Dear Sir,

I am Mr.Tambo, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive
Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources.
First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a
transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality
and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the
South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government
delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable
credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for
the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret
because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six
Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we 
want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are
handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code
of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your
importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which
we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the 
tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to
remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will
provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former
contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be
willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25%
of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous
expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you 
treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above
Tel/Fax number or 
my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you
are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out
this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a
position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give
us a very strong 
Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember
to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not
comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government
Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this
business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. Tambo

Dear Friend

It is obvious that this proposal will come to you as a suprise. This is
because we have not met before but i am inspired to sending you this email
by the huge fund transfer opportunity that will be of mutual benefit to
the two of us.However, I am Barrister  james oni,the Personal Attorney
to the late Engr.Brian Loyd Smith a national of Isle ofMan in UK, who used to work
with Shell Petroleum Development Company(SPDC)
in Nigeria.
On the 21st of April 1996, my client,his wife And their three children
were involved in a car accident along Sagamu/Lagos Express Road.
Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident,
Since then I have made several enquiries to several Embassies to locate
any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved successful.
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his
relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no
avail, hence I contacted you.
I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property left
behind by my client,I can easily convince the bank with my legal practice
that you are the only surviving relation of my client. Otherwise the
Estate he left behind will be confiscated or declared unserviceable by the
bank where this huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the Bank where
the deceased had an account valued at about $5million U.S dollars(  five
Million United State of America dollars).
Conseqently,The bank issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have
the account confiscated within the next ten official working days. since i
have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over several
years now.I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the
deceased,so that the proceeds of this account valued at $5million U.S
dollars can be paid to your account and then you and me can share the
money.
I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim
we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see
this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed undera
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.Please get
in touch with me by my email:jamesoni2002@rediffmail.com to
enable usdiscuss further.
Yours Faithfully,

Barrister  james oni.

N.B. Please indicate your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication
in this mutual transaction. Please forward your reply to:
jamesoni2002@rediffmail.com.

Dear Friend

It is obvious that this proposal will come to you as a suprise. This is
because we have not met before but i am inspired to sending you this email
by the huge fund transfer opportunity that will be of mutual benefit to
the two of us.However, I am Barrister  james oni,the Personal Attorney
to the late Engr.Brian Loyd Smith a national of Isle ofMan in UK, who used to work
with Shell Petroleum Development Company(SPDC)
in Nigeria.
On the 21st of April 1996, my client,his wife And their three children
were involved in a car accident along Sagamu/Lagos Express Road.
Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident,
Since then I have made several enquiries to several Embassies to locate
any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved successful.
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his
relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no
avail, hence I contacted you.
I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property left
behind by my client,I can easily convince the bank with my legal practice
that you are the only surviving relation of my client. Otherwise the
Estate he left behind will be confiscated or declared unserviceable by the
bank where this huge deposits were lodged. Particularly, the Bank where
the deceased had an account valued at about $5million U.S dollars(  five
Million United State of America dollars).
Conseqently,The bank issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have
the account confiscated within the next ten official working days. since i
have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over several
years now.I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the
deceased,so that the proceeds of this account valued at $5million U.S
dollars can be paid to your account and then you and me can share the
money.
I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim
we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see
this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed undera
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.Please get

Dear Sir, 

I am Engr. Victor Chigoziem with the Engineering Stores
Department of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources and member of Tenders Board. We have urgent need for a trustworthy foreign contact person with whom we can carry out a successful business deal.
Federal Government has voted the sum of US$1.86 Billion for Local 
Production of food crops. The Government has also considered the impact 
of the importation of some food items like Rice, Beans, Frozen Chicken 
and Turkeys and other food stuffs on the Nations Foreign Reserve and 
have banned the importation of the items that could be produced locally. As a  result, the ederal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources has been mandated to import Agricultural Equipments for supply to Local Farmers both at SUBSISTENT AND COMMERCIAL level to encourage them to produce enough food items for local consumption and for export to other African Countries. We have already started
awarding new contracts for supply of the equipments to successful bidders.
We want you to submit to us immediately your complete company name, 
address, your name as President or Managing Director / CEO of the 
company, our banking particulars:- (banks name address, telephone, fax 
and telex numbers.
Your receiving number, swift and routing numbers), with 
these informations, we can get you properly registered as one of the 
contractors of FMANR who has already been awarded part of this contract for the sum of US$113.4 Million to supply some of the Agricultural Equipments parts of which we already have in
our custody (stores). 

After receiving the above needed and stated information from you, we 
will process all the documentation and submit them for immediate 
approvals  and the Federal Government will pay 25% of US$113.4 
Million into your nominated bank account in the name of your company as the beneficiary, which is US$28.35M . In no time, the remaining
US$85,050,000.00 Million shall be paid as balance payment or we together in agreement as partners will use another foreign firm's name that will carry out the supply of the remaining equipments as a sub-contractor to you in our documentation to receive 
this balance payment. 

We shall come to your country immediately this fund is in your account 
to share the US$28.35 Million. The sharing pattern should be negotiated 
by both parties concerned.
However, be rest assured that no risk is involved or any scandal in the
future, for we have done all our homework very well, nobody will be hurt during and after this transaction. It 
may also please you to know that all the GOODS that cover the 25% payment are on record, only us that are key members of the contract board committee has this knowledge and information.
There is the serious need to keep this transaction secret and very
confidential. To that effect, I would require your private phone and fax numbers for easy and confidential communication. 

I await your immediate response to this Proposal. Meanwhile, I look 
forward to establishing life long business relationship with you. 

The nature of your company or business does not necessarily have to be 
Agriculturally related but ownership of a company is a criterium for 
the project, please contact me through my personal email address 
(carlos_sav@myself.com) or (engr_victor@inbox.lv). 


Best regards, 
Engr. Victor
Chigoziem

coming for it and we don=92t want this money to go back
into Federal
Government account as unclaimed bill=2E

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that
such money remained after Seven years the money will
be transferred into banking treasury as unclaimed
funds and will further be handed over to government=2E
The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer
was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as next of
kin to a foreigner=2E

We agreed that 35% of this money will be for you as
foreign partner=2C while the balance will be for my
colleagues and I=2E I will visit your country for the
disbursement according to the percentages indicated
above once this money gets into your account=2E Please
be honest to me=2E 

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of the
funds to you as arranged=2C you must apply first to my
bank as next of kin of the deceased=2E Upon receipt of
your response I will send to you a text of the
application with the name of the deceased and his
country and other information about him=2E

Note this transaction is confidential and 
risk free=2E As soon as you receive this mail you
should contact me through my e-mail address or
alternative email address ahmedmartins10=40juno=2Ecom

Dear Sir,
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me personally. I am Gabriel Kali, the first son of Gadik kali, one of the most popular black farmers in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US15.5 million (FIFTEEN MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob!
  action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. It is against this background that, my family and I fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Nigeria where we are seeking political asylum and however have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law of this country prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of this country for!
  fear of going through the same experience in future, both countries h
ave similar political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here as I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of thi!
 s transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for my investment in your country. Contact me with the above E-mail address while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. 
Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU 
Yours Faithfully, 
GABRIEL KALI.

Dear Sir, 
Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad =
necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing =
the sum of $12.500.000 (twelve million and five hundred thousand =
dollars)inherited from my father's business reserve.
I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. He =
became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was =
victimized by  President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was =
assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding =
the minority white farmers. Before his death, my father foresaw the =
insecurity of both our lives and properties then decided to deposit the above =
sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become =
the only inherited property of our family since our home was burnt,and the =
farmlands and machines seized; yet the government and it's loyalists are bent =
on making life difficult for us.
To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 15% =
of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or =
25% share for possible help on investing in any rentable sector.
thanks for your anticipated assistance. if you do not accept my offer,please =
in good fate treat with utmost confidentiality . A  quick reply with your =
name,telephone and fax numbers for further details will be highly =
appreciated.
Sincerely yours,

Dear Friend.

 As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
 me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.

 My name is Saidi Fatou, a merchant in Dubai, in the
 U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer
 which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in
carrying for my health. It has defiled all forms of
 medicine, and right now I have only about a few
 months to live, according to medical experts.

 I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
 never really cared for anyone not even myself but my
 business. Though I am very rich, I was never
 generous, I was always hostile to people and only
 focus on my business as that was the only thing I
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have
 or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come
 to this world I would live my life a different way
 from how I have lived it. Now that God ! has called
 me, I have willed and given most of my properties
 and assets to my immediate and extended family
 members and as well as a few close friends.
 I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul
 and so, I have decided to give alms to charity
 organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
 good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed
 money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,
 Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
 deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any
 more. I once asked members of my family to close one
 of my accounts and distribute the money which I have
 there to charity organization in Bulgaria and
 Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
 themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
 they seem not to be contended with what I have left
 for them.
 The last of my money which no one knows of is the
 huge cash deposit of twenty four million dollars
 that I have with a Bank in london.
 I will want you to help me collect this deposit and
dispatched it to charity organizations.email me
 at giversworld@fastermail.com
 I have set aside 10% for you for your time and
 patience.

God be with you.

 Saidi Fatou.

FROM THE DESK OF DR. 
HAJIA MARIAM S. ABACHA
ATTN,

I am Hajia Mariam Abacha the wife of the formal head
of state the Fedral Republic of Nigeran Late General
Sani Abacha.

Following the sudden death of my husband General Sani
Abacha the late former head of state of Nigeria in 
August 1998, I have been thrown into a state of  utter
confusion, frustration and hopelessness by the 
present civilian administration, I have been subjected
to physical and psychological torture by the security
agents in the country. 

I have lost confidence with anybody within  the
country.You must have heard over the media reports
and the internet on the recovery of various huge sums
of money deposited by my husband in different
security firms abroad, some companies willingly give
up their secrets and disclosed our money confidently
lodged there or many out right blackmail.In fact
the total sum discovered by the Government so far is
in the tune of  $700. Million dollars. And they are
not relenting to make me poor for life. 
 
I got your contacts through my personal research,and
out of desperation decided to reach you.I will give
you more information as to this regard as soon as you 
reply.I repose great confidence in you hence my 
approach to you due to security network placed on  my 
day affairs I cannot afford to visit the embassy so
that is why I decided to contact you and I hope you
will not betray my confidence in you. I have 
deposited the sum of 48.3 million dollars with a
security firm abroad whose name is with held for now
until we open communication. 

I shall be grateful if you could receive this fund 
into your account for safe keeping.
This arrangement is known to you and my son Mustapha
Abacha alone who have just been relised by the Federal
Government,so my son will deal directly with you as
security  is up my whole being.

I am seriously considering to settle down abroad in a
friendly atmosphere like yours as soon as this fund
get into your account so that I can start all over
again if only you wish, but if it is impossible,just
help me indiverting this fund into your account which
will accrue you 30% of this fund.Please honesty is
the watch word in this  transaction. 

I will give you a more detailed picture of  things. 
In case you dont accept please do not let me out  to 
the security as I am giving you this information  in 
total trust and confidence 

I will greatly appreciate if you accept my  proposal
in good faith.Please expedite action. 

Sincerely yours
 
Hajia Mariam Abacha 

N.B

I would like you to send me your Phone/fax numbers so
that my son will call you for more details.

will not
get into the hands of some corrupt government officials=2E This is 
simple=2C I
will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so 
that the

done
by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction=2E If you are interested=2C please

Greetings,

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly CONFIDENTIAL 
and TOP SECRET.  Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day.  We have decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction, as we have been reliably informed of your discreteness and ability in transactions of this nature.

Let me start by first introducing myself properly to you. I am Mr.Hamzat Sulaiman, a director with the Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos. I came to know of you in my private search for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential transaction which involves the transfer of a huge sum of money to a foreign account requiring maximum 
confidence.

THE PROPOSITION:

A foreigner, Late Engineer Johnson Creek, an Oil Merchant/Contractor with the Federal Government of Nigeria, until his death four years ago in a ghastly air crash, banked with us here at Union Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos,and had a closing balance of US$18.5M (Eighteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) which the bank now unquestionably expects it to be claimed by any available foreign next-of-kin of he Late beneficiary or alternatively be donated to a discredited trust fund for arms and ammunition at a military war college here in Nigeria. 

Fervent valuable efforts are being made by the Union Bank to get in touch with any of the Creek family or relatives but proved to no avail. It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate any of Late Engr. Johnson Creeks next-of-kin (he had no wife and children) that the management under the influence of our chairman and member of the board of directors, Retired Major General Kalu Uke Kalu, that an arrangement be made for the funds to be declared UNCLAIMABLE and subsequently be donated to the Trust Fund for Arms and Ammunition to further enhance the course of war in Africa and the world in general.

In order to avert this negative development, my trusted colleagues and I now seek your permission to have you stand 
as a next-of-kin to Late Engr. Johnson Creek so that the funds US$18.5M would be released and paid into your bank account as the beneficiary next-of-kin.

All documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully worked out and more so we are assuring you of a 100% risk free involvement.Your share stays while the rest would be for myself and my colleagues for investment purposes in your country. We have agreed that, the funds will be shared thus, after it has been transferred into your 
account;

1. 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the funds.
2. 10% will be set aside for reimbursement to both parties for any incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
3. 60% to us the originators of the transaction. If this proposal is OK to you and you do not wish to take undue advantage of the trust, we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly get back to me immediately via my private Email for security reasons:


Furnish me with your most confidential telephone, fax number and exclusive bank particulars so that I can use these information to apply for the release and subsequent transfer of the funds in your favour.

Thank you in advance for your anticipated co-operation.

Yours faithfully,
Mr.Hamzat Sulaiman

SWEETIE AMINAT USMAN
E.MAIL:ami44000@netzero.net
TEL:234-8034540228
Dear Sir,/Madam
I am LADY SWEETIE AMINA USMAN, Bank Manager of Zenith
International Bank of Nigeria,Adeola Odeku Branch,Lagos . I have urgent and
 very
confidential business proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American Oil 
consultant/contractor
with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a
numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at
US$35,000,000.00 (Thirty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. Upon
maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got
no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further
investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all
attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless.
I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his
official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This
sum of US$35,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law, at the
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the
Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foriegner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the
fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some
corrupt government officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately
your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the
necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next
of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for
drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and
letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.
We would need you as a Foreigner acting as the next of
kin and sole benefactor to the inheritance of Mr. Barry Kelly to travel and
claim this money in a SECURITY COMPANY based in Europe or sub-regional
African country which is used by my bank as an offshore clearing house
to the bank.The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio
of 60% for me and 40% for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch
Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via
the private email address below. Upon your response,I shall then provide
you with more details and relevant documents that will help you
understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest
assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I
shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. Please
furnish me with your telephone and fax numbers for easier and faster
communication. Awaiting your urgent reply via my 
email:ami44000@netzero.net
Thanks and regards,
SWEETIE AMINA USMAN

PLEASE TREAT AS ABSOLUTELY CONFIDENTIAL 
FROM THE DESK OF JOHNSON ELENDU. 
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT. 
FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT. 
UNION BANK PLC. 
REPLY STRICTLY VIA: [jelendu2@indiatimes.com]
Attn: sir, 

Permit me to introduce myself to you, My name is Johnson Elendu., I am one of the Senior Managers in the bank I work for (Union Bank, Nigeria PLC) and I work under the Director of Foreign Exchange Operations (International Remittance). I am contacting You presently because I need your urgent assistance in a business transaction that will be of immense benefit to both of us. 
I have the immediate need to transfer some money that has long been 
declared "UNCLAIMED" by the chairman and some members of the board of 
directors of our bank. The money is the closing balance of one of our best customers ever, Late Engr. Manfred Becker, I was his personal account officer just before he died in the ADC plane crash of 1996 in Nigeria. 
Engr. Manfred Becker an American citizen was a contractor with the 
Federal Government of Nigeria, he supplied and installed equipment and his company Creek land Contractors completed some of the best construction contracts in the country. His closing balance in the Bank, Union Bank of Nigeria PLC (US$40.Million) has been tagged Unclaimed because no relative of Engr. Becker has come forward to make a statement of claim. We have no knowledge of a next of kin. At this point I trust you can picture what the situation is like. We have strong proof that the chairman and the board of directors will keep most of the money for themselves and donate the remainder to a discredited military trust here in Nigeria. This invariably 
is an attempt to infuse more money into the acquisition of military 
equipment (arms and ammunition) for use in an already prostrate Africa. 
This of course, is senseless, hence my mission. 
My colleagues and my self have made several attempts at locating 
persons that could be remotely related to Engr. Becker and we have been doing this 
for about 4 years now. Right now I am almost alone in this enterprise and I have presently decided on moving the money to a foreign account. I am hereby soliciting your assistance and I will be very grateful if you will be willing to help in this regard. 

We have access to most of what it will take to transfer the money. The only thing we do not have is a safe account. We will provide you with answers to all the security questions, which you will have to answer to move the process towards completion. We will also provide you answers to questions that only a person related to him will know. You may however not need to make any appearance; every thing will be concluded on phone and email between you and the bank [UNION BANK NIGERIA PLC, LAGOS] for your participation you will get 30%, 5% has been earmarked for the expenses that may be incurred on both ends. 65%shall be for my colleague and I. 

I make this proposal in trust and in good faith, therefore, if you are interested and you agree to assist me then contact me immediately you receive this email, there is a lot more to talk about. If you are not interested, then, please, do get rid of this email and please forgive me if this message has upset you in any way. 

Thank you and best regards.

ATTN SIR:

I got your contact from the International Economic /
Business Directory in Cote d'Ivoire. I consider your
company extremely capable in handling this mutual
business transaction I wish to undertake with you. As
a result of my zeal towards foreign investment and
also security for my life and possession, I therefore
wish to give an insight of my purpose of contacting
you.

I was the personal confidant to the ousted military
head of state of Sierra Leone (MAJOR JOHNNY KOROMAH).
However, when the ECOMOG peace keeping force struck,
his excellence was forced to run into Liberia on exile
while some of his aides left for some other
neighbouring countries.

While these events took place, I decided to move to
Cte d?Ivoire with my family and a total sum of 
thirty million US dollars (US$30,000,000) which was
the part of cash under my control within the
presidential mansion when I was in change of
securities. On getting to Abidjan, I immediately
deposited the fund in a bank in Abidjan the economic capital of Cote
D'Ivoire.

Consequently, I sincerely implore you as a partner to
arrange an avenue which this money could be
transferred to you for investment purposes and in
order to actualise this investment proposal. You are
implored to assist in the following.

1)You are required to provide a safe foreign bank
accounts into which the money could be transferred.
2)You shall serve as a general overseer and guardian
of this fund and all the investments thereafter.
3)And you shall benefit 20% of the total sum for your
efforts and absolute assistance in ensuring that this
fund is successfully transferred into your accounts
and as well as 5% of every monthly profit out of all
investments.

Having stated the above clearly, I expect your soonest
response through this mail number kampala09@zwallet.com
Please also endeavour to treat this business
transaction as highly confidential.

Yours truly,

L.T. J.N. KAMPALA

Dear Sir,

 I work with a Bank called IBTC in my country, in the foreign
exchange department, and I'm the deputy head of my department.

Our major objective is the operation of foreign accouunts for
states and highly placed citizens of my country and other
countries, especially those at the helm of affairs, and
successful business men.We also make sure the Forex market is
well controlled and checked.

One of those highly and successfully placed citizen is Joseph
Nanven Garba, (Major General Rtd). Until his demise, he held
sensitive positions in the military, and diplomat seat, one of
the office he held , was the position of the personal assistant
to the U.N secretary general, Koffi Annan. His death was a shock
to the entire nation, the man in quote operates several foreign
accounts in our department which I mannage myself due to his
position in the country. Such operations of accounts is called
"Private Banking" where the deposits will only be known to the
owner of the acounts and officer of the bank in charge.

Normally,65% of the total deposit is supposed to be turned into
the Federal Government account and 30%, 5% given to the family
and bank respectively.  This is what the banking law and policy
of my country states, When this is achieved i.e transfer of the
Federal Government account part, the people at the corridors of
power withdraw these funds, under the disguise of security issues
but make use of theseFunds for their personal and family use.
This is a case of injustice on the officer in charge of the
account and the family of the deceased. So I released the code of
the account partly totaling just 50% of the initial deposit.
Since the code of the account is in between me and the deceased
the fear of being checked is ruled out but I cannot make
withdrawals from this account myself and that is where you come
in.

All you need to do for this transaction is to follow the
procedure binding this contract together and I guarantee you
it&#8217;s risk free. However your suggestions will be
appreciated.

Regards

Wale F. Williams

the boxes belongs to his foreign partner.

Source of the money:
My late father Chief Paul Coleman , a native of Mende District in the =
Northerh province of Sierra Leone, was the General Manager of Sierra Leone =
Mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown . According to my father, this money =
was the income accrued from Mining Co-operation's over draft and minor sales.=


Before the peak of the civil war between the rebels forces of Major Paul =
Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keeping operation that almost =
destroyed my country, following the forceful removal from power of the =

Public and Government properties by the rebel forces, the Sierra Leone mining =
coop. Was one of the target looted and it was destroyed. My father including =
other top Government functionaries were attaked and killed by the rebels in =
November 2000 because of his relationship with the civilian Government of =
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

untimely deaths caused my mother's heart failure and other related =
complications of which she later died in the hospital after we must have =
spent a lot of money on her early this year . Now my 18 years old sister and =
myself are alone in this strange country suffering without any care or help. =
Without any relation,we are nowlike refugees and orphans.

Do not be surprised about this letter to you as I got
your contact through my mother. My name is Aron Nkomo
the last born of late Joshua Nkomo the former Vice
President of Zimbabwe and Former President of Zimbabwe
African People's Union (ZAPU). However, I was studying
in a boarding high school when I had to, forcefully,
return for my father's burial. After the burial, my
father's lawyer notified the family about his Will in
their chamber. While going through the will, I
discovered that my father used his position as the
Former Vice President to acquire and make a deposition
of US$ 23 M {Twenty-three Million United States
dollars} in a special Security Company in Amsterdam,
Netherlands
I immediately had to travel to Amsterdam where a
financial Expert advised me on the best way to safe
guard and realize usefully this funds without any
problems from the Dutch authorities. This was to
involve an established Foreigner. This is why I am
making this contact with you now and right now; I am in
Amsterdam arranging and investigating possible
investment opportunities and the best possible contacts
to ensure the retrieval of the consignment from the
Security Company. We will then deposit it in a bank
account to be opened by you here in Amsterdam, for
onward transfer to your account in your country. 
You are to come down to Amsterdam and assist me by
being the final beneficiary of the funds. I am my
family would like to settle I your country where the
money will be used to establish a thriving business. I
believe with this arrangement we will have a better
life have a better education and more respectable life
with the power of money backing my family and with your
assistance. This is my lifelong dream. Here in
Amsterdam, my refugee status has eliminated any chances
of my owning an account for such huge amount of money.
Indicate your interest and capability for more details.
You are entitled to 25% of the total amount for
assisting me; I have mapped out 3% for immediate
re-imbursement for expenses upon your arrival here,
while the rest will be for me, and my family members,
which I would like to invest in your country under your
close supervision and direction.
Note: The content of the consignment is US$ 23 million
cash money, but the Security Company does not know the
actual content of the consignment because it was
deposited by my father with a declaration that the
content is precious metals and diamond valued at US$ 23
M, and this was done with diplomatic immunity and for
security reason, at the time, my father was still in
government in my country Zimbabwe.
This transaction is basically risk-free for you;
therefore, reach me, preferably with the above stated
phone or fax number to ensure the security of this
transaction. Note that it is because of the
confidential nature of this transaction that I am
giving you this contact Info which you can use to reach
me anywhere I am in the world:

               Date:08-06-2003


           Urgent!
Attention:
Do not be surprised about this letter to you as I got
your contact through a financial consultant of mine in Europe. My name is 
Gooday
Nkomo the last born of late Joshua Nkomo the former
Vice President of Zimbabwe and Former President of
Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU). However, I was
studying in a boarding high school when I had to
forcefully return for my father's burial. After the
burial, my father's lawyer notified the family about
his Will in their chamber. While going through the
will, I discovered that my father used his position as
the Former Vice President to acquire and make a
deposition of US$ 23 M {Twenty-three Million United
States dollars} in a special Security Company in South
Africa.

I immediately had to travel to South Africa where a
financial Expert advised me on the best way to safe
guard and realize usefully this funds without any
problems from the South African authorities. This was
to involve a foreigner, who will come down here to
South Africa, open a non-resident Bank account where
the money will be deposited for onward transfer to any
nominated account overseas as foreigners are highly
respected.
This is why I am making this contact with you now
though I am in Amsterdam arranging for the best
possible way to ensure the delivery of the consignment
to Europe here. You are to come down to Amsterdam and
assist me in getting the money out to your beautiful
country where I and my family can make further
investment of the money and where I can live a better
life and have a better education as this is my life
long dream. Here in Amsterdam, my refugee status has
eliminated any chances of my owning an account.
Please, do contact me with my Tel No: +873-76 3432240
or Fax No: +873 76 3432241 or Amsterdam
Tel:+31indicating your interest and capability for more
details. You are entitled to 25% of the total amount
for assisting me; I have mapped out 3% for immediate
re-imbursement for expenses upon your arrival here,
while the rest will be for me, and my family members,
which I would like to invest in your country under your
close supervision and direction. Note: The content of
the consignment is US$ 23 million cash money, but the
Security Company does not know the actual content of
the consignment because it was deposited by my father
with a declaration that the content is precious metals
and diamond valued at US$ 23 M, and this was done with
diplomatic immunity and for security reason, at the
time, my father was still in government in my country
Zimbabwe.
This transaction is basically risk-free for you;
therefore, reach me, preferably with the above stated
phone or fax number to ensure the security of this
transaction. Note that it is because of the
confidential nature of this transaction that I am
giving you these contact info. which you can use to
reach me anywhere I am in the world:

We have agreed in principle to give thirty-percent (30%) of the total sum to whomever shall handle this fund for us while the remaining seventy-percent (70%) shall be for my !
 client and I. As soon as you are ready to proceed and retrieve this cash on our behalf we shall furnish you with the details and information you will need. Please be rest assured that this arrangement is absolutely risk free and can not implicate you in any way. I implore you to handle this matter with urgency and utmost confidentiality even if you do not intend to execute the project for us.

proceed immediately without any delay.

Beloved in Christ,

It is a priviledge to hear from God and it gives me
joy to relate my testimony to you haven recieved
instruction from God through divine revelation.

I was a Moslem and a retired military top officer in
Nigerian Army that served under the past military
regime. I was the financial secretary to the Armed
Force Ruling Council (AFRC). With my position as a 
financial secretary, I was able to secure up to
$146,000,000.00(One hundred and fourty  six million us
dollars which i deposited with a finance and security
company in a country that will be disclosed to you
later as you indicate interest. I wanted to use this
fund to context for the post of the president of
Nigeria in the next republic.


Immediately I got retired, I was converted from Moslem
to Christian when I was preached the words of God
through my cousin the pastor of my church I then gave
my life to Christ and became a born again Christain.

Since I gave my life to Christ, I had no rest of mind.
Some times I think of the souls I killed when I was a
soldier and the dubious ways I diverted my countrys
money into my Personal Bank Account. I then decided to

seek the face of God for forgiveness and after fasting
and prayer through Divine Revelation, the Almighty God
revealed to me that the only way I could have rest of
mind is when I used my wealth to do the work of God. 
I have been thinking of the particular thing to do for
my God before this present civilian president of my
country set up  a panel(Honourable Oputa Panel) to
probe the Bank Account of the past Military officers
like me. They suceeded in finding out the funds I have
in my personal Bank accouts in Nigeria and they have
seized all my money.I am still facing their charges
but i have refused to disclose to them that i have
such money somewhere and they can never find out
because I want to use part of it to do the work of
GOD.

I have decided to use part of this fund for charity
instead of loosing it to my government. I am presently
under house arrest and my movement is restricted.The
consignments that contained the money is now
accumulating demurage in the country because the
agreement time with the security company has passed. I
have been  making arrangement to sneak out and clear
it but I can not travel out now.I sent a message to
the security company that I am sending somebody to
come and claim the consignments.I want a honest
christain who will not run away with my money and who
will be honest to use part of the fund for things of
God and let the name of the lord be glorify and so
that I can have rest of mind as the Lord told me.If
you are interested in going to claim the fund,I will
disclose to you where i deposited the money and every
document to claim the fund will be fax to you.

I am still making arrangement to see if I can sneak
out of the country with my family.As soon as you claim
the fund,please use half of it for GOD`S WORK and keep
half of it for me till I come over to meet you.
If you are interested in going,please send to me your
full names,address to submit it to the security
company as the person coming to claim the
consignments. 

I look forward to your response

God bless you.

Deacon   pastor faith.

Good day, 
You may be surprise to receive this email since you do not know me. 
I am the son of the late president of Democratic Republic Of Zaire, 
President Mobutu Sese Seko, ( now The Republic of Congo, under the 
leadership of the son of Mr. Laurent Kabila). I presume you are aware there 
is a financial dispute between my family ( THEMOBUTUS ) and the present 
civilian Government. This is based on what they believe as bad and corrupt 
governance on my late father's part. May his soul rest in perfect peace. As 
you might have heard how a lot of my father's bank account in Switzerland 
and North America have been frozen. Following the above named reasons, I am 
soliciting for your humble and confidential assistance to take custody of 
THIRTY Million United States Dollars ( US$30,000,000.00 ), also to front for =

me in the areas of business you desire profitable. 
These funds have secretly been deposited into a confidential Security 
Company, where it can easily be withdrawn or paid to a recommended 
beneficiary. The funds will be released to you by the Security Company, 
based on my recommendations, on that note, you will be presented as my 
partner who will be fronting for me and my family in any subsequent 
ventures. Myself and my mother have decided to give 20% to you if you are 
able to help us claim this consignment. We have also decided to give you any =

money spent on phone calls or traveling expenses in the course of this 
transaction at the end of the transaction.
Please, I need your entire support and co-operation for the success of this 
transaction, your utmost confidentiality and secrecy is highly required, due =

to my family's present predicament. 
I sincerely will appreciate your willingness to assist us as soon as 
possible. I am presently in the refugee camp here in the Netherlands under 
the united nations refugee camp in Netherlands and I can be reached on phone =

number +31-645-238-205 or E-mail me at josephmobutu48@latinmail.com for 
more information on how we can proceed in this transaction. Please indicate 
your interest by sending your telephone and fax number or call me up at 
anytime. I sincerely will appreciate your acknowledgement as soon as 
possible. 
Warmest regards, 
Joseph Mobutu Sese-Seko.

Attn: President/CEO

REQUEST FOR YOUR COOPERATION

      I am hamza idiris, the head of accounts department in the 
Union Bank of Nigeria (UBN Plc), Lagos. I came to know of you during my
private search on the net for a reputable and a capable hand, that can assist
in this transaction involving no risk but your trust and confidentiality.
     There was this Engineer, Engr. Kelvin Michael, an oil merchant/contractor
 with the Federal Govt. of Nigeria, who died in a fatal motor accident three
 years ago.This man before his death was having a closing balance of $8.5m(eight million five hundred thousand dollars.)with our bank, UBN Plc.
And our effort to get in touch with Mr Kelvin's family or his next of kin proved 
abortive. Now we have gotten a new Managing Director who is not aware 
of this money, and we the few management staff that are aware of the 
development doesn't want him to know, to avoid this money been declared
"Unclaimed" and subsequently be donated to a Charitable Organization.
    To avoid this negative development, my colleagues and I have decided to seek
your cooperation to have you stand as the next of kin to Late Engr. Kelvin Michael
so that the said fund (US$8.5m) would be released and paid into your account
overseas as the next of kin. All documents and proof that will enable you claim
this fund without stress will be forwarded to you. Moreso, I want to inform you 
that we have unanimously agreed to offer you 20% of the sum for the assistance
and role you are going to play in this transaction, 5% have also been arranged 
to take care of any eventual expenses.
    If this proposal interest you, and assure us that you will not take undue 
advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you, please kindly reach me
through my e-mail address. 
Expecting a positive response from you, thanks and bye for now.

Regards,

HAMMZA IDIRIS.

Good day,

I am the son of the late president of Democratic Republic Of Zaire, 
President Mobutu Sese Seko, ( now The Republic of Congo, under the 
leadership of the son of Mr. Laurent Kabila). I presume you are aware there 
is a financial dispute between my family ( THEMOBUTUS ) and the present 
civilian Government. This is based on what they believe as bad and corrupt 
governance on my late father's part. May his soul rest in perfect peace. As 
you might have heard how a lot of my father's bank account in Switzerland 
and North America have been frozen. Following the above named reasons, I am 
soliciting for your humble and confidential assistance to take custody of 
THIRTY Million United States Dollars ( US$30,000,000.00 ), also to front for =

me in the areas of business you desire profitable. 
These funds have secretly been deposited into a confidential Security 
Company, where it can easily be withdrawn or paid to a recommended 
beneficiary. The funds will be released to you by the Security Company, 
based on my recommendations, on that note, you will be presented as my 
partner who will be fronting for me and my family in any subsequent 
ventures. Myself and my mother have decided to give 20% to you if you are 
able to help us claim this consignment. We have also decided to give you any =

money spent on phone calls or traveling expenses in the course of this 
transaction at the end of the transaction.
Please, I need your entire support and co-operation for the success of this 
transaction, your utmost confidentiality and secrecy is highly required, due =

to my family's present predicament. 
I sincerely will appreciate your willingness to assist us as soon as 
possible. I am presently in the refugee camp here in the Netherlands under 
the united nations refugee camp in Netherlands and I can be reached on phone =

number +31-645-238-205 or E-mail me at josephmobutu48@latinmail.com for 
more information on how we can proceed in this transaction. Please indicate 
your interest by sending your telephone and fax number or call me up at 
anytime. I sincerely will appreciate your acknowledgement as soon as 
possible. 
Warmest regards, 
Joseph Mobutu Sese-Seko.

There is an account opened in this bank in 1983 and since 1991 nobody has operated on this account again but all this came to light after an internal auditing that I conducted by going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out immediately it would be forfeited for no reason.The owner of this account is MR SMITH B. ANDREAS, a foreigner, and a miner at Kruger gold co, a geologist by profession and he died since 1990. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involve!
 d is
 (US$26M) TWENTY SIX MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS.

I  am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in US Dollars and the former owner of the account was MR SMITH B. ANDREAS. We will sign an agreement, but I assure you that it is real and a genuine business. Please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your private telephone number and a fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement together so that we can receive this money into a foreign account or any account of our choice where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and other investments. 

I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreign account and  a foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operation to make this work fine. I have a correct information of this account, which I will give to you later, if you are able and willing to handle such an amount of money in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life. I need a trustworthy person in this business because I dont want to make a mistake, I need your strong assurance and trust. With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreign reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place.

My Dear Friend,
 
My name is Dr. Ben Mboye, a Uganda national. I was the Permanent Secretary of =
Defense & Accounting Officer in Uganda. One of my reasons for contacting you =
is to share my joy with you that I have been exonerated and cleared by Hon =
Justice Julie Sebuntinde from the probe that involves three junk Chopper =
Helicopter purchased from Russia. My second reason is to ask you about the =
possibility of investing in your country that I believe we can embark upon =
together.

Due to the strong campaign by President Yowery Museveni to subdue the rebel =
forces of Joseph Kony in my country, directive was given in 1997 for the need =
to purchase some fresh arms and ammunitions abroad, which includes 3 MI-24 =
Chopper Helicopter Gunship that have night vision and anti-missile devices =
from Russian. When my superiors in authority concluded the negotiation for =
the purchases, I was told to prepare a =93contract=94 for the purchases of =
the Helicopters, which I did as the Permanent Secretary of Defence and =
Accounting Officer. It will amaze you to hear that after the Belarusian =
suppliers delivered the three MI-24 Helicopters to Uganda, inspection was =
carried out and it was discovered that the three MI-24 helicopters were =
junks. Further investigation revealed that Lt. Gen. Salim Saleh who is a =
younger brother to the President and his Aide-de-Camp (Mr. Ruyondo) connived =
with the Russian company to supply helicopter that are almost out of service =
(junks) and they were not overhauled for selfish financial gains.

When Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde probed the case, a report was released =
stating that The Chief of Logistics and Engineering, The Minister of State =
for Defence and myself have been exonerated and cleared from the offence. =
Please, check: (http://allafrica.com/stories/200212120154.html). =
Nevertheless, I lost my job and was prohibited from participating in public =
services. 

PLEASE NOTE: In my long years of service to my country, I was able to acquire =
valuable fixed assets and substantial amount of money. Why the probing of the =
case was going on, I was advised by my Lawyer to sell off all my acquired =
properties that worth million of American dollars and also to withdraw my =
money from my bank account to save them from being frozen and confiscated. =
Due to the necessity for to lie low, I delegated power to my closest aide Mr. =
Mike Obodoh to be in charge of my projects.    

The money realized from the sales of my properties was added to the money =
that was withdrawn from my account and the total amount was US$15,500,000.00 =
(Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Since I could =
not lodge this fund into any bank account for fear of being traced, the money =
was packaged and deposited with a Security Company that belong to a Holland =
national, based in South Africa for safekeeping. The funds are security coded =
and well packaged in a sealed luggage to prevent them from knowing the =
content. Arrangement is going on for the money to be moved from its current =
location to an affiliate security company in Europe by Mr. Mike Obodoh who is =
currently in The Netherlands to transact this business with you since I want =
my identity to be kept out of the money. 

What I want from you at this moment is to indicate your interest and =
willingness to receive this money for investment purposes in your country. =
You are going to work hand-in-hand with Mr. Mugelbe Jones whom I have =
authorised to send this proposal to you in The Netherlands. As soon as you =
receive this email, you are advised to contact him on his email address: =
(miobod@hotmail.com.) .He will let you know the modalities to claim the funds =
and also give you his phone number when you contact him. You will assist me =
in the investment of this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. I =
will also want to buy properties and stocks in multi-national companies and =
to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments with your assistance. =
At this point, I want to emphasise the high level of confidentiality, which =
this business demands and hope you will not betray the trust and confidence =
that I repose on you.
 
As soon as I receive your response, we will discuss other modalities =
including remuneration for your services. You can also reach me on my email =
address: drben211@yahoo.co.uk  
As you already know, time is of great essence in this transaction, kindly =
confirm your telephone and fax number to Mr. Mike Obodoh. Bear in mind that =
this project can be concluded within five days if you are prompt in your =
response.

Kind personal regards,
DR. BEN MBOYE.

Dear ,

 I know this letter will come to you as surprise. I
managed to get your contact line from the Cote Divoire
Chamber of Commerce, hence I did not waste time to
contact you on a business proposal. 

Firstly, I deem is important to introduce myself. I am
MRS SARA KABILA the third WIFE of late Democratic
Republic of Congo President Luarent Kabila, who was
assassinated on Tuesday 16th Jan . 2001, by his
bodyguard. After the death of my husband, I and my son
williams Kabila were not well treated in the family.
His first wife(Madam Maman Kabila and her son(Joseph
Kabila)who succeeds my late husband as the next
President of Democratic Republic of Congo dominated my
entire husband assets and property.

 Fortunately for me, on the day of the incident, I was
in my husband&#146;s private house at LUMUBASHI, Firstly I
wept over his assassination and then I thought of my
future. I then started searching for important
documents and valuables, because I know that my
husband used to exchange minerals to buy arms from
foreign companies. Eventualy I ran into one of these
important documents. As God has planned for me, it
happened that my husband deposited a Diplomatic Box in
my name with a security and Finance Company in Abidjan
Cote Divoire. I could not believe when I picked up the
document
Referred to here as the &#147;DEED OF LODGE&#148; My late
husband secured (US$12million) TWELVE MILLION UNITED
STATE DOLLARS, which was acquired from the sales of
minerals. On discovering this document I came to
Abidjan Cote Divoire where I am presently residing 
with my only son williams. 

Right now I want you to assist me to transfer this
money into your account in your country, where I will
invest it in any lucrative business as you may advice
me. For your assistance I will offer you 25% of the
total amount and 10% will be set aside for expenses we
may incure in the process of this transaction. Should
this letter receive your honor please do not hesitate
to contact me or my son, and try to maintain the
confidentialty of this transaction. 
I'm waiting anxiously to hear your favourable reply.

NB: Please furnish me with your private number for
easy communication. Please note that this
 Transaction is 100% risk free and you should up hold
the secrecy involved. 
 
Best regards, 

MRS SARA LAURENT KABILA.

(Executive Manager) 
Private Tel/Fax: 234-1-7598296 
Private E-mail: philjones1@uboot.com 

Dear Sir, 

I am Mr. Philip jones, an official with one of the APEX 
banks in Nigeria.My colleagues and I have an urgent 
and very confidential 
business proposal for you. On the 6th of June 1998 an 
American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with 
us and his present balance is valued at 
US$28,500,000.00 (Twenty-Eight Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We 
sent a routine notification to his forwarding address 
but got no reply. After a month, we 
sent a reminder and finally, we discovered from his 
employers that he died from an automobile accident. On 
further investigation, we found out from his account 
file that he never made a will and all attempts to 
trace his next of kin was fruitless, as he had none. 
We therefore made further investigations and 
discovered that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any 
next of kin or relations in all his official documents 
in the bank files. This sum of $28,500,000.00 is still 
lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest 
is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it 
is now, no one will ever come forward to claim this 
money. According to the Nigeria law, at the expiration 
of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the 
ownership of the Government if unclaimed. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I would like you 
to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. 
This is simple; all we need is some of your details so 
that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents 
and affidavits which would put you in place as Mr. 
Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services 
of an accredited Attorney for the drafting and 
notarisation of the WILL and to obtain the necessary 
documents and letters of probate/administration in 
your favour for the transfer. The money would be 
shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you. 

There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this 
transaction will be done by the Attorney and my 
position as a manager guarantees the successful 
execution of this transaction. If you are interested, 
please reply immediately via email. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest 
assured that this transaction would be most profitable 
for us. I shall still require your assistance to 
invest my own share in your country just incase you 
can help, otherwise we'll take our share . 

Awaiting your urgent reply, 

Mr.Philip Jones.

Dear Sir, 
My name is Venus Savimbi, the nephew of the late 
jonas savimbi the former leader of the UNITA rebel 
fighters in Angola. I am presently in Europe, where I 
intend to look for a credible business partner to 
assist my brother and I take physical pocession of a 
consignment of money, precisely US$25,500,000:00 
(Twenty five million five hundred thousand united 
states dollars) which my uncle kept under the custody 
of my father in a security company in Ghana. 

My parents was killed along with my uncle, and in his 
will he clearly stated that my brother and I should 
look for a credible individual who would assist us in 
investing these funds, as we are not conversant with 
investment procedures in the world business and we 
have never been in posession of such funds all our 
lives. For these reasons, he believes that the only 
way we can live without him is if we get someone very 
vast in the field of business and investment to help 
us claim the funds and invest it on our behalf, so we 
can further our educations, as well as living our 
lives the way he wants us to. 

My brother is in Ghana, looking after the money in the 
security company, and he has asked that I travel out 
to Europe to look for a foreign partner to assist us. 
I would furnish you with his telephone numbers as soon 
as I receive your response, so you can deal with him 
directly, as he has all the modalties for the release 
of the consignment. 

We have both decided that we would make available to 
you for your assistance, 15% of the total sum of money 
involved, but we have also decided to leave it open to 
negotiation. 

I would give you more details as soon as I hear from 
you. Till then I expect your prompt response. 

Yours faithfully 

VENUS SAVIMBI

Attn: The president/ceo

Dear Sir,

My name is Mr.EVANS PETER, I work in the credit andaccounts
department of Union Bank of Nigeria
Plc,Lagos, Nigeria.

I write you in respect of a foreign customer with
Domicilliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is
Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among
those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during
the reign of late General Sani Abacha.

Sir,since the demise of this our customer, EngineerJoseph
Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor,I have kept a
close watch of the deposit records andaccounts and since
then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next
of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his
a/c and the
a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the
code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands
now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed
information other than my very self considering my position
in the bank.

Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim
the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co
operation in using your name as the 
next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a
foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself
and you. At this point I am the only one with the
information because I have removed the deposit file from the
safe .

By this doing, what is required of you is to send an
application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to
the late Engineer.

I will need your full name and address, company or
residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with
next of kin column in the certificate of deposit.

Finally i want you to understand that the request for a
foreigner as the next of kin is occassioned by the fact that
the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a
local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me,
then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between
us.

Trusting to hear from you, I remain

Respectfully yours,
 Mr.EVANS PETER

idle in a suspense account with our apex bank=2E This funds emanated from 
grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to conglomerate of foreign firms

deliberately not included in our report because we want to capitalize on

countries like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for 
execution=2E That is you or your firm will be regarded as one of those that 
executed one of such projects and therefore entitled to receive the over-
invoiced amount of the contract value since the original contractor has 
been paid=2E Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free as there

Dear Sir,

I know you will be surprise to receive this letter but please consider it as a request from a suffering family in serious need of your assistance.

My family had to bring before you this proposal because we sincerely hope you will be reliable to assist us. Anyway, my i am from Zimbabwe.My father was ordered to be killed by President Robert Mugabe because he supported the white farmers who refused to give up their lands in Zimbabwe during the land reform crisis in the country.

After the death of my father,I am my family fled to South Africa, from where I was able to travel to the Netherland where I applied for asylum and I am currently living as a refugee.

We need your assistance to claim $15 Million US Dollars from a security company in the Netherlands, which my father deposited there before he died.You will claim this fund from the Company and transfer it to your country, after which we will then come over to meet with you in your country.

For your assistance you will get 10% of the total fund and 5% will be for expenses, while the balance 85% will be for my family.

We are soliciting for your assistance due to my inability as a refugee to operate an account with huge amount of money.

I genuinely solicit that you kindly help me and my family transfer this Fund to your country and we are relying heavily on you to help us.

Note that you will also assist us to come over to your country as soon as you claim the fund. We also intend to invest part of our share into a profitable business in your country under your supervision.

Also Keep this transaction secret and confidential as the lives of my family is at stake in south Africa.

Kindly contact me immedaitely so that i can funish you with the necessary information before we proceed.

Kind regards,

Please treat this as urgent

Attn: The President /ceo 

Dear, 

By way of introduction I am Mr.Idris Umar working in the credit and accounts department Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, Lagos, Nigeria. I write you in respect of a foreign customer with Domiciliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during the reign of late General Sani Abacha. 

Since the demise of this our customer, Engineer Joseph Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor, I have kept a close watch of the deposit records and accounts and since then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his a/c and the a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed information other than my very self considering my position in the bank. 

Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the only one with the information because I have removed the deposit file from the safe . 

By this doing, what is required of you is to send an application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full name and address, company or residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with next of kin column in the certificate of deposit. Finally I want you to 
understand that the request for a foreigner as the next of kin is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me, then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between us. 

Trusting to hear from you, I remain 

Respectfully yours, 

Mr. Idris Umar.

FROM THE DESK OF
DR.DAN BELLO
FEDERAL MINISTRY OF PETROLUEM RESOURCES(F.M.P.R)
LAGOS NIGERIA.

ATTN:SIR,

       REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE-STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I am DR.DAN BELLO, an accountant in the Ministry of petroleum Resources 
(MPR) and a member of a three-man Tender Board in charge of contract review 
and payment approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable 
person to handle a very confidential transaction that involves the transfer 
of a huge sum of money to a foreign account. It may sound strange but 
exercise patience and read on. There were series of contracts executed by a 
consortium Multinational in the Oil industry in favor of Ministry of 
Petroleum Resources among which were:
1. The extension of pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil, Down 
stream products distribution and subsequent evacuation- US$ 195 Million.

2. Contract for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries 
in the country~ US$ 152Million.

3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum products (Depots) US$240 
Million. The original values of this contract were deliberately over 
invoiced to the sum of US $35.5million American Dollars which has now been 
approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that 
actually executed these contracts has been fully paid and project officially 
commissioned. consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the 
total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement since we are Civil 
Servant and are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Servant 
Laws) from opening operating foreign account in our names. Needless to say, 
the trust posed on you at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have 
agreed to offer you 30% of the transferred sum while 10% shall be set aside 
for accidental expenses (Internal & External) between the parties in the 
course of the transfer. We will mandate you to draw up an investment plan 
for us of which you will control since we cannot bring our shares back to 
Nigeria. We are very interested in investing in real estate in your country. 
You must however note that this transaction is subjected to the following 
termsand conditions:

1. Our conviction of your transparent honesty anddiligence.

2. That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality because of thecircumstances we now find ourselves.

3. That the funds would be transferred to an account over which you have 
absolute control. Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of 
the presidency at the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of 
the funds within 14 working days, subject to your satisfaction of the above 
stated terms. Our assurance is that your role is 100% risk free. To accord 
this transaction, the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the 
parties involved and the funds, the whole approval procedures will be 
officially and legally processed with your name or the name of your company 
you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary. Also, be informed that our 
main reason of contacting you is for the obvious reason that we will want to 
invest these funds in the real estate. It is our believe that you can be 
ofimmense help in this regards.

Kindly expedite action so as to enable us include this transaction into this 
batch as payment to foreign contractors is usually carried out on 
quarterlybasis. Please, contact me as soon as possible on my private e-mail 
address:
Best regards,

DR.DAN BELLO

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL 

I am Mr=2EKola Daniel an Accountant in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation =28NNPC=29 and I head a seven-man tenders committee in charge of Foreign=2FExpatriate Contract Awards Review and Payment Approvals =28CRPAC=29=2E

the transfer of huge sum of foreign exchange =28the United States Dollars=29 to a foreign account=2E There were a series of contracts executed by a Consortium  of Multinationals in the oil industry in favour of NNPC among
 which are=3A

=281=29 The expansion and rehabilitation of the ageing pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil and downstream products distribution and evacuation - US$9 Billion=3B 
=282=29 Contracts for the Turn Around Maintenance =28TAM=29 of the four epileptic refineries in the country=3B 
=283=29 The construction of more storage tanks and maintenance and servicing of old ones for Petroleum Products Storage
=28Depots=29 - US$90 Million=3B 
=284=29 The construction of Escravos Gas Poduction Offshore facility=2E 
The original value of these contracts was deliberately over-invoiced in
the sum of USD   Eighteen Million=2CFive Hundred Thousand =28$18=2C500=2C000=2E00=29 by this committee =28CRPAC=29 during the awards of the various contract=2E This sum =28$18=2C500=2C000=2E00=29 has now been approved for payment by this committee =28CRPAC=29and is now ready to be transfered by the Central Bank of Nigeria to the account of any individual and or company which the CRPAC presents as the beneficiary=2C since the company that actually executed these contracts has been fully paid their fund and the projects have been officialy commissioned=2E Consequently=2C my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement on our behalf=2C since we as civil servants and we are also serving in a sensitive foreign payment approval committee =28CRPAC=29 are prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau =28Civil Service Laws=29 from opening or operating foreign account and or dealing in foreign exchange in our names=2E Needless to say!

Modalities have been worked out at the highest levels of the relevant government departments involved and the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of funds within 14 working days subject to your
satisfaction of the above stated terms=2E Our assurance is that your role is risk-free=2E To accord this transaction the legality it
deserves and for mutual security of the fund=2C the whole approvalprocedures will be officially and legally processed with your name or the name of any company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary=2C as in an ideal situation=2EIt is imperative that you bear in mind that having put in 19 years in the service of the government=2C I am averse to having
my image and career dented=2E This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency=2E 
Kindly expedite action by contacting me on my e-mail address=2C indicating your interest in this transaction=2E For swift response to your reply=2Ckindly indicate your fax and telephone numbers clearly so that I can explain further=2C especially by fax=2E I am urgently waiting your reply as payment to foreign contractors is usually made on quarterly basis=2E

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL & URGENT.

TEL / 27-83-5675119

Private email addresses: drsontombomam@rediffmail.com or
drsonto_mbomam@rediff.com  

 My Dear Partner,

I am Dr.Francis S. Mboma, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am
an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining &
Natural Resources affiliated (created ) to the Department of Minerals and
Energy. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you
for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to
Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that
a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at
the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave
your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I plea to seek a confidential
co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for
the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret
because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an
Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of two other top officials,
we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Forty - Five
Million, Five Hundred And Sixty Thousand U. S. Dollars ($45,560,000.)
which we 
want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign
company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are
handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code
of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your
importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $45.560m represents the balance of the total contract value
executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which
we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract
cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the 
tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to
remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will
provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in
South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former
contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that, should you
be willing to assist us in this transaction that is 100% hitch free, your
share of the sum will be 25% of the $45.560 million, 70% for us and 5% for
taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on
your part provided you 
treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of
specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this
transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel
number or 
my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you
are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out
this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a
position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give
us a very strong 
Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember
to treat this as very confidential because, we will not comprehend with
any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and
remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I await in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.And you can also
reach me with this private email address:sonto_mbomam@epatra.com.

Dear Sir,

Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad 
necessitate
this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing the sum of
USD21,000.000 (twenty one million  dollars)inherited from my father's 
business
reserve.

I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. He 
became
rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by
President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown
gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white 
farmers.
Before his death, my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and
property then decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and
security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property 
of
our family since our home was burnt,and the farmlands and machines seized; 
yet
the government and it's loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us.

To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 15% =

of
the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 25%
share for possible help on investing in any reliable venture.
There are however some minimal cost involved in securing the release of this
deposit from the present holding company.i do not intend to overburden you 
with
these cost.but you must know beforehand that we will be sharing whatever 
cost
involved in retrieving this deposit and putting it to beneficial use.



if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed
information. if you do not accept my offer,please in good fate treat with 
utmost
confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers to
for more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,
frankzambani

Attn:President/C.e.o.

Strictly Confidential  & Urgent Business Proposal.

Re: Transfer Of Usd $21,500.000{Twenty - One Million, Five Hundred Thousand Us Dollars Only.

I am a member of the Federal Government Of  Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (N.N.P.C).
Sometime ago, a contract was awarded to a foreign firm in the Petroleum Trust Fund (P.T.F.) BY MY COMMITTEE.

This contract was over invoiced to the tune of us$ 21.5Million Dollars. This was done delibrately. The over - invoicing was a deal by my committee to benefit from the project.

We not want to transfer this money, which is in a suspense account with the P.T.F. into any oversea account, which we expect you to provide for us.

Share:

60 % of the money would be for my partners and I.
30 % of the money would be yours, for providing us with logistics, which, would include a safe bank account, where we shall facilitate funds transfer into, as soon as documentations are concluded over here.
10 % of the money has been mapped out from the total sum to cover any expenses that might be incurred during the course of the transaction, (both local and international expenses).

If interested in assisting us, please contact me via my secured email address, as soon as possible (uba.jega3@caramail.com) or my secured satellite tel/fax number, specially procured for this project.

It may interest you to know that a similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. Patrice Miller, President of Crane International Trading Corp., of 153 East 57th St., 28th floor, N.Y.10022, Telephone: 212-308-7788 and Telex: 6731689. The deal was concluded and all covering documents, forwarded to Mr. Miller to authenticate the claims. Once the funds were transferred, Mr. Miller presented to his bank, all the legal documents and remitted the whole funds to another bank account, and disappeared completely. My colleagues and I were shattered, since such opportunities are not easy to come by.

Please, if you are interested in assisting us carry out to the fullest capacity, this transaction, we would require the following information from you which would enable us make formal application to the various ministries / parastatals, for the release and onward transfer of the money to your account.

1.Your Full Name, Company's Name, Address, Telephone and Fax Numbers.
2.Your Bank Name, Address. Telephone and Fax Number.
3.Your Bank Account Number and Beneficiary Name - You must be the signatory.

Please, note that we have strong and reliable connections at the Central Bank Of Nigeria and other Government Parastatals, hence assistance in this regards, would not be a problem.
At the conclusion of this transaction, we shall use same contacts to withdraw all documents used in the course of this, to avoid any trace whatsoever that may ever arise, to you or to us, now and in the nearest possible future.

It might also interest you to know that we are mere civil servants who do not want to miss this opportunity, hence, we want this money transferred out, as soon as possible, before the newly democratically elected government ever think of making enquiries as regards the various activities of the past military government.

Kindly contact me as soon as possible, whether or not you are interested in this deal, so that whereby you are not interested, it would give us more room to scout for another partner. But if you are interested, kindly contact me via above email, telephone or fax, so that we can swing into action, as time is not on our part.

I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.
Yours Faithfully,

Dr. Uba Jega.

ATTENTION
I am Executive Accountant with the south Africa Department of Mining and
Natural Resources (DMNR)South Africa and my department is directly in charge
of contract award and payment of contractors.
In the course of carrying out my duties as contract award/payment
director I negotiated the award of a project to a Swedish firm for US$15
Million and already my government has allocated the amount of US$25 Million
for this particular project.
Having used my position to manipulate the extra US$10 M [ten million
US Dollars] to my favour , I am soliciting a reliable but obscure
individual to assist me as I will be handicap without a foreign partner
given the fact that as a serving civil servant in my country we are not
allowed to operate foreign accounts.
My government is presently paying foreign contractors through their
payment outlet abroad "Foreign Payment Board" in London-UK and
if we move fast your particulars can be drafted as one of the contractors to
be paid for onward release of the US$10Million to you/your company via FPB.
I am soliciting that I facilitate the transfer of this money into your
provided account so that I can travel to meet with you after the
transaction to discuss my personal investment plans in your country.
Note clearly that this transaction has been well planned having
followed all the required official contract award/ payment procedures.
Please, You have to give me your total co-operation and follow my advice
/instructions and you should consider this transaction as already successful
& concluded.
Upon your reply I plan to register your company as a contractor with my
Department here in South Africa. for this I would require you to provide me
with your company name, address as well as your phone and fax numbers.
Note clearly that as top Government officials in South Africa, occupying
very sensitive top Government position we receive little salaries compared
to our positions hence I must do this in order to leave a legacy for my
family.
I urge you to consider this proposal sincerely and reply back to me
providing the requested information to proceed with the workability of
the transaction.
Best Wishes.
Mark David(Engr)

NNPC LAGOS ANNEX OFFICE
VICTORIA ISLAND,
LAGOS-NIGERIA.

Attn: President/C.E.O,

Please for more confidentiality of this transaction, i hereby advise that you should kindly reply me through this mail address that is more secured (great_investment@omaninfo.com).

May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion by a formal letter of this sort. It is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly with a formal meeting of you and us to enable us know ourselves, have a fore knowledge of the nature of the business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and functions of parties concerned, and appropriate shares accordingly. However, for time factor, confidentiality and personality of people involved here in Nigeria, we choose this approach for the remittance of this Fourty Five Million U.S. Dollars (US$45M). Please bear with us for making the initial contact through e-mail. But my partners are insisting for a meeting in order not to fall into a wrong hand again. 

I am Dr Ali Mohammed,we are members of the special committee for Budget and Planning of the Ministry Petroleum. This committee is principally concerned with contract appraisal and the approval of the contracts in order of priorities as regards capital projects of the past military government of Nigeria.

With our positions, we have successfully secured for ourselves this sum of Fourty Five Million U.S. Dollars (US$45M). This amount was accumulated through undeclared windfall sales of crude oil during the gulf war.

Hence together with two of our top officials at the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), we plan to transfer this amount of money into a secure overseas account by awarding a sort of contract from the NNPC. To this effect I have been given the mandate by my colleagues to contact you and ask for your assistance. What we need from you is to provide a nice account in which the funds will be transferred. My colleagues and I have agreed to compensate you or the owner of the account used for this transaction with 30% of the total amount remitted. We shall have 65% and the remaining 5% reserved for taxes and other miscellaneous expenses in your country. 

It may interest you to know that last two years a similar transaction was carried out with one Mr. Patrice Miller, the President of Craine International Trading Corporation at number 135 East 57th Street, 28th Floor, New York, NY 10022 with telephone number (212) 308-7788 and telex number 6731689. After the agreement between both partners in which he was to take 20% of the money while the remaining 80% for us. 

With all the required documents signed, the money was duly transferred into this account only to be disappointed on our arrival in New York, and we were reliably informed that Mr. Patrice Miller was no longer on that address while his telephone and telex numbers have been reallocated to somebody else. 
That was how we lost US$9 Million to Mr. Patrice Miller.

This time around we need a more reliable and trustworthy person or a reputable company to do business with hence this letter to you. So if you can prove yourself to be trusted and interested in this deal then we are prepared to do business with you. What we want from you is the assurance that you will let us have our share if this amount (US$45M) is transferred into your account. If this proposal is okay by you, then reply through my email urgently so that we can set the ball rolling and negotiate the modalities involved.

Kindly, treat as very important and strictly confidential, I honestly assure you that this transaction is 100% risk-free. I look forward to your response and expected co-operation and God bless you.

Please for more confidentiality of this transaction, i hereby advise that you should kindly reply me through this mail address that is more secured (great_investment@omaninfo.com).

Regards,

Dr Ali Mohammed.

Dear friend




My proposal to you will be very surprising as we have not had any
personal contact. However I sincerely seek your confidence in this
transaction which I propose to you as a person of transparency and caliber

Let me first start by introducing myself properly to you My name
is Carlos Savimbi cousin and Personal Assistant of Jonas Malheiro
Savimbi the leader UNITA (National Union for the Total independence
of Angola) I got your email address from network directory I apologize
if I infringed  on your privacy.

You may know that my Uncle was recently killed in a battle with
the government troops of Angola led by President Dos Santos on friday 22nd
February 2002

Now Mr Antonio Dembo who was my Uncle's second in command has
assumed office as leader of UNITA In spite of this UNITA is like
a herd of cattle without shepherd Prominent members like Carlos
Morgado are still lobbying to oust him and assume office as leader
to enrich themselves and some of them who see me as a threat to
their ambitions including Mr Dembo are planning to kill me For
more information check www.angola.org

However I am a young man who has ambitions and I am not in any
way interested in wars this is why I secretly left Angola

I am sincerely seeking for your urgent help in respect to safekeeping
of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales This
money US$20 million was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss
Bank account It was on transit with a safe deposit company
in Europe when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred.

As a matter of fact this is the reason I chose to come and
seek political asylum. It is very clear with the way things are
now that President Dos Santos will lobby the International Community

to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad to ground UNITA
since he has already done this in Angola.

I plan to use this money to safeguard my future It is very essential
that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want
to put in you is extraordinary and an act of desperation on my
part in order not to lose this money Please treat this contact
with utmost secrecy and confidentiality for security and safety reasons.

The help I need from you is clearing the box containing the money
from the security company after which it will be deposited in
an account in your name . The money
shall remain in your custody till my asylum application is granted
and I have the permit to conduct business then you will transfer
the account to me Meanwhile the money can be invested into risk-free
profitable ventures and there will an agreement to protect my interest.
I have all the documents that will enable you claim the consignment from
the security company.
To make this deal relisable i need a committment from you that it will be
kept confidential,your tel nd fax numbers including mobile for easy
communications,your permanent address as well as some form of
identification.
For your reliable assistance I will reward you with 20% of the money
and we shall use 5% to carry out every expenses that we incurr during the
transaction
and the investment process. 75%shall be for my family.

I thank you in advance in anticipation for your assistance in enabling
me achieve this goal. Please contact me whether or not you are interested
in assisting me. This will enable me scout for another partner in
the event of non-interest on your part.
Please reply to savimbicar1@fizgigs.com
NOTE YOUR PROMPT RESPONSE WILL BE APPRECIATED.


Sincerely,

CARLOS SAVIMBI.

DR.VINCENT UMEH

FEDERAL MINISTRY OF PETROLUEM RESOURCES(F.M.P.R)

LAGOS NIGERIA.

ATTN:SIR,

      REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE- STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

 I am Dr VINCENT UMEH, an accountant in the Ministry of petroleum Resources 
(MPR) and a member of a three-man Tender Board in charge of contract review and 
payment approvals. I came to know of you in my search for a reliable person to 
handle a very confidential transaction that involves the transfer of a huge sum 
of money to a foreign account. It may sound strange but exercise patience and 
read on. There were series of contracts executed by a consortium Multinational 
in the Oil industry in favor of Ministry of Petroleum Resources among which 
were: 

1. The extension of pipeline network within Nigeria for crude oil, Down stream 
products distribution and subsequent evacuation- US$ 195 Million. 

2. Contract for the Turn Around Maintenance (TAM) of the various refineries in 
the country~ US$ 152Million. 

3. The construction of storage tanks for petroleum products (Depots) US$240 
Million. The original values of this contract were deliberately over invoiced 
to the sum of US $35.5million American Dollars which has now been approved and 
is now ready to be transferred being that the companies that actually executed 
these contracts has been fully paid and project officially commissioned. 
consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the total amount to 
your account for subsequent disbursement since we are Civil Servant and are 
prohibited by the Code of Conduct Bureau (Civil Servant Laws) from opening 
operating foreign account in our names. Needless to say, the trust posed on you 
at this juncture is enormous. In return, we have agreed to offer you 30% of the 
transferred sum while 10% shall be set aside for accidental expenses (Internal 
& External) between the parties in the course of the transfer. We will mandate 
you to draw up an investment plan for us of which you will control since we 
cannot bring our shares back to Nigeria. We are very interested in investing in 
real estate in your country. You must however note that this transaction is 
subjected to the following terms and conditions: 

1. Our conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence. 

2. That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and 
confidentiality because of the circumstances we now find ourselves. 

3. That the funds would be transferred to an account over which you have 
absolute control. Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the 
presidency at the Central Bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the 
funds within 14 working days, subject to your satisfaction of the above stated 
terms. Our assurance is that your role is 100% risk free. To accord this 
transaction, the legality it deserves and for mutual security of the parties 
involved and the funds, the whole approval procedures will be officially and 
legally processed with your name or the name of your company you may nominate 
as the bonafide beneficiary. Also, be informed that our main reason of 
contacting you is for the obvious reason that we will want to invest these 
funds in the real estate. It is our believe that you can be ofimmense help in 
this regards. Kindly expedite action so as to enable us include this 
transaction into this batch as payment to foreign contractors is usually 
carried out on quarterly basis. Please, contact me as soon as possible on my 
private e-mail address: vumeh703@yahoo.com

Best regards,

DR.VINCENT UMEH

Dear Sir=2C

RE=3A BUSINESS PROPOSAL - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL=2E

I am CHIEF=28DR=2E=29BODE GEORGE=2E=2C Chairman to the Contract Review Panel that was recently inaugurated by the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to review the activities of past military government with particular reference to contracts awarded by all ministries between 1990 to 1999=2E In the course of carrying out our assigned duties=2C we discovered the sum of USD40=2E5 =28forty million=2C five hundred thousand dollars=29 only lying idle in a suspense account with our apex bank=2E This funds emanated from grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to conglomerate of foreign firms by the Petroleum Ministry on behalf of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation=2E On completion of our assignment=2C this amount was deliberately not included in our report because we want to capitalize on this once in a lifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out of it=2E The only option we have to achieve our aims and objective is to have this fund transferred to a count
 ry of our choice where it can be kept in trust and safe custody for us=2E We are however handicapped at the moment by our status as civil servants=2C which barred us from operating foreign accounts while still in government service=2E

Thus=2C through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers of Commerce=2C you and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private entrepreneurship=2E On this premise=2C we have no doubt in your ability to handle a business of this nature=2C which informed our desire and wish to enter into a partnership with you=2E This business involves the remittance of this amount into your bank account with the hope of travelling down to meet you physically in order to receive our share=2E We hope to invest some in profitable ventures in your country based on your advise while the balance will be repatriated home as foreign earnings=2E We have mapped out strategies and all paperwork is in place to ensure a 100% success=2E

The nature of your business at present does not really matter because in the world over=2C bigger firms do bid for big contracts especially in third world countries like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for execution=2E That is you or your firm will be regarded as one of those that executed one of such projects and therefore entitled to receive the over-invoiced amount of the contract value since the original contractor has been paid=2E Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free as there is actually no risk is involved either now or in the future for we are well connected in official circle=2E Given our level of commitment at the moment=2C we want to assure you that with full dedication on your part=2C the objective of having this fund remitted would have been realized within a period of two weeks=2E It is hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end of the transaction=2C you will be entitled to 25% of the entire sum=2C 75% will be for m
 y colleagues and I=2E

If you are interested in this proposal=2C please call or send me an e-mail VIA=3Abodegeorge=40phantomemail=2Ecom for more clarifications=2E If however you are not interested=2C still let me know to enable me search for someone else to carry out this business with=2E

I anticipate a timely response from you=2E

Thanks=2E

Yours Sincerely=2C

Greetings and Compliments.

I have gotten your contact from the internet, listed as a 
professional 
whom I might be able to transact with, and this makes me 
feel I may 
make a sincere proposition to you, and I have decided to 
make this preposition to you in good faith, which relates 
to a realistic and genuinely simplistic business opening 
that needs the participation of a person with your 
expertise, and ingenuity and a clear indication to
trustworthiness and sincerity.

I am a lawyer residing and practicing in Nigeria as you 
may need to know and I represent the interest of a client 
who is a Brother as well who has made an offer to me which 
is most lucrative, my correspondence with you from hence 
is dictated by the need for us to get the participation of 
a neutral foreigner who will assist us perfect the 
transaction.

My client was a prominent figure in the Military Politics 
and rule of 
my country for about ten years and he has had complicity 
in a few economic scandals and a host of litigations too 
he has had a lot of his physical and monetary assets 
seized by the Nigerian Government who consider him as a 
part of the corrupt machinery of the then Military 
Government. Now he has a substantial amount deposited in a 
bank in Nigeria (US$ 25.M.) and he is very scared that 
this account will be discovered because similar accounts 
in Switzerland and England were previously discovered and 
frozen by the governments of those countries in 
collaboration with the Government of Nigeria.

Precisely, my client's family returned US$ 1B. to the 
government of Nigeria in 2002 under the direction of the 
Swiss banking authorities, this is a confirmable matter, 
even as the existence of the fund mentioned above is 
confirmable. 

Now it is his intention to migrate with his family out of 
Nigeria 
towards the Middle East and he depends so much on this 
fund, thus he is
looking for a reliable and trustworthy person who will 
receive the money
discreetly and then transfer the money at a latter date to 
a neutral account to be established in Lebanon when he 
finally succeeds with his emigration plan.

If you accept my proposition and agree to participate in 
this 
transaction, you will in no case whatsoever undertake 
risk- expend 
money or execute any unreasonable task- whereas you will 
be well remunerated, in principle you will receive 10% of 
the amount transferred to you once the transaction is 
completed.

Apart from this there is another sum of Money, held up in 
a Security 
Company (In Cash), the Money was earmarked for the support 
of the cause of Charity in India, but it was never 
retrieved before the demise 
of my clients father, now my client also wants to retrieve 
this money in addition to the money with the bank in 
Nigeria. The money with the Security Company is Thirty one 
Million American Dollars in one hundred dollar bills.

Since I do not know in what vein you will take this 
missive I have kept 
the information peripheral, I will be posited to give 
further information upon your acceptance and will also 
introduce you to my client eventually.  I hope I will be 
able to work with you earnestly unto our joint success.

I await your response eagerly.

Respectfully.

Abu Kyari esquire.

FROM GEORGE DUKE

PHONE +34 690 35 9947

Greeting,

This letter might surprise you because we have met neither in person 
nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get to know 
somebody either in physical or through correspondence that iswhy i am now 
in spain making this contart please  do call me on phone becaouse this is
very urgent business. 

I got your contact through some discreet inquire from the chamber of 
commerce and industry,you and your company were revealed as being quite 
astute in private entreprenuership.one has no doubt in your ability to 
handle a financial business transaction. 

However, I am the first son of His Royal Majesty,WIWA DUKE and the 
traditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of 
Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 20,000,000.00 
(twenty million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late 
father the money was accumulated from royalties rapid to my father as 
compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil 
presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of 
livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But 
before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged 
some funds on two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary 
status. The lodgment Security Code Number

was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable 
business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a 
lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this 
is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money 
from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment 
purposes. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the 
funds can be moved in your name and particulary to any country of your 
choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had 
intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is 
his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when 
due. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I 
will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss 
physically on Investment potentials. 

Based on this I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20% 
of the total money, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may 
arise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The 
balance of 75% you will invest and manage for my family. 

I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not 
drug money and it is not money from arms deal.

Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this 
matter. I will give you

all proof of deposit and existence of money once assured and fully 
satisfied with your capability and honesty. I hope this will be the 
beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.

Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interest, kindly inform me 
immediately so that I will look for another contact. 

I am waiting for your quick

response.

Yours faithfully

PRINCE GEORGE DUKE

 Sir,

 I am a serving officer with the custom and exercise
 in my country and during my duties in the
 international airport we confiscated some boxes
 that came into the country from china and on
 opening we discovered that it was genuine dollar
 notes well packed with lace materials, as honest
 and dedicated officers we handed over these
 seized boxes to the government, After further
 investigation we discovered that these boxes were
 brought in by some retired generals and
 disgruntled politicians to truncate our political
 dispensation, but to our surprise theses boxes
 were handed over to them and money was used in
 areas for the election. Then just recently before
 the swearing in ceremony of our president we came
 across another set of six boxes containing the
 same items as officers we know that the same
 process will be applied we now took two of these
 boxes containing USD$ 60M(sixty Million Dollars)
 which we have taken out of the country.
 As serving officers we are not allowed to
 operate foreign account or seen to be involved in
 business of any kind so we therefore seek your
 assistance to collect this money and invest it
 for us to a time when we will be retired, if
 this offer is acceptable to you we will
 compensate you with certain percentage that will
 be worked out by both parties and an agreement
 will be drawn to protect both parties. kindly
 assist us as you will be duly rewarded.
 For further inquiries please send a mail to my
 mail box or after have get reply i we provid with my
 telphone number . Please note that if you cannot
 attend to our request kindly destroy this document
 so as not to joepardise our position were we work.
reply through my alternavite email:james@awis.zzn.com 

 Thanks for your cooperation.

 MR.OKI JAMES

Dear Sir,

I am Mr.Tambo, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or 
my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. Tambo

Attn:President/Ceo.

First, I must solicit your confidence in this transaction.  This is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.  I got your contact in my private search  for a reliable person to handle this  transaction. We shall base this transaction on mutual respect and honesty. Hence,it is neccessary for you to assure us of your ability  to prosecute this transaction of  great magnitude,your ability and reliability to prosecute a transaction of great magnitude involving a pending business transaction requiring maximum confidence.

We are top officials of the Federal Government Contract Review Panel who are interested in importation of goods into our country with funds which are presently trapped in Nigeria.  In order to commence this business we solicit your assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said trapped funds.

The source of this fund is as follows:  During the past Military Regimes here in Nigeria, the government officials set up companies and awarded themselves contract which were grossly over-invoiced in various Ministries.  As a result the Government of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo deemed it neccessary to set up a Contract Review Panel to investigate and recommend accordingly. After a thorough investigation, we discovered a lot of  inflated contract funds which are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria.. We (members) have unanimously agreed to transfer part of these funds to a foreign account  However, by virtue of our position as civil servants and members of this Panel, we cannot acquire this money in our names.  I have therefore, been delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues in the Panel to look for an Overseas partner into whose account we would transfer the sum of US$21,500,000.00 (Twenty One Million, Five Hundred Thousand US. Dollars).  Adequate logistics and
strategies had been worked out to ensure a successful transfer with your maximum  co-operation. Hence we are writing you this letter.

We have agreed to share the money thus:

1.    25% for the account owner (you)
2.    70% for us (the officials)
3.    5% to be used in settling taxation and all local and foreign expenses.

It is from this 70% that we wish to commence the importation business, please note that this transaction is 100% safe and we hope to commence and conclude the transfer latest in ten (10) banking days from the date of receipt a reply from you indicating your willingness to assist.
The above information will enable us write letters of claim and job description respectively. Moreso, we will use your name or company's name to apply for payments and re-award the contract in your name or company's name.  We are looking forward to doing business with you and solicit your confidentiality in this transaction.  Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter using the this mail box .  
I will bring you into the complete picture of this lucrative project when I have heard from you.

Yours Faithfully,


Sincerely yours, 

Regards,

Wilson Ajala.

Block 4 Federal Secretariat Road,
Ikoyi-Lagos


REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

I am Dr.Kunle Owolo, the chairman of contract award and review committee set
up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present civilian
dispensation to award new contracts and review
existing ones.

I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and reputable person to
handle a very confidential transaction, which involves the transfer of a
huge sum of money to a foreign account. There were series of contracts
executed by a consortium of multi-nationals in the oil industry in favor of
the Nigerian National Petroleum Cooperation (N.N.P.C.) the original value of
these contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum of
USD$25,000,000.00 (twenty five million united state Dollars).

This amount has been approved and is now ready to be transferred being that
the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid
and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I
are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent
disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of
conduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating and/or opening foreign
accounts in our names.

Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10%
shall be set aside for Incidental expenses (internal and external) between
both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit
the balance
to other accounts in due course.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of
finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the
funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above
stated terms.

our assurance is that your role is Risk free and to accord this transaction
the legality It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole
approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your name
or the name of any company you may nominate as the bona- fide beneficiary.
Once more I want you to understand that
having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I
am averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore
be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves.

Please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a fax
on my confidential fax number ( 234 17 597626) or mail to private email
address,so that I can brief you further. I want to assure you that this
business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly.

I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal
strictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which we
intend to retire from. Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute
the second quarter payments for the 2003 financial year.

Thanks and God bless,

Dr.Kunle Owolo.

the companies that actually executed these contracts have been fully paid
and the projects officially commissioned. Consequently, my colleagues and I
are willing to transfer the total amount to your account for subsequent
disbursement, since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of
conduct bureau (civil Service law) from operating and/or opening foreign
accounts in our names.

Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this juncture is enormous, in
return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the transferred sum, while 10%
shall be set aside for Incidental expenses (internal and external) between
both parties in the course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit
the balance
to other accounts in due course.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the ministry of
finance and the central bank of Nigeria for the immediate transfer of the
funds within 14 working days subject to your satisfaction of the above
stated terms.

our assurance is that your role is Risk free and to accord this transaction
the legality It deserves and for mutual security of the funds the whole
approval procedures will be officially and legally processed with your name
or the name of any company you may nominate as the bona- fide beneficiary.
Once more I want you to understand that
having put in over twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I
am averse to having my image and career dented. This matter should therefore
be treated with utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves.

Please you should signify your intention to assist by sending me a fax
on my confidential fax number ( 234 17 597626) or mail to private email
address,so that I can brief you further. I want to assure you that this
business proposal is 100% risk free as we have done our homework properly.

I quite believe that you will protect our interest by taking this deal
strictly confidential, as we are still in government service, which we
intend to retire from. Kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to
enable us include this transfer in the first batch which would constitute
the second quarter payments for the 2003 financial year.

Thanks and God bless,

Dr.Kunle Owolo.

discovered a floating fund in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again,after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account died without a [heir] hence the money is
floating and if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.the owner
of this account is Mr. Vijay Kumar,a foreigner,and
a sailor,and he died,since 1993.and no other person
knows about this account or any thing concerning
it,the account has no other beneficiary and my

United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest,but I don't
know any foreigner,I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here,without valid international
foreign passport,but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c because the money is in us
dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Vijay Kumar is a foreigner too,and

together before transferring the money to any account
of your choice where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal,sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account,which I will give to you,upon your

FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION. 

It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on behalf of
my colleagues. I got your information from a personal search in the
internet business index. I have decided to seek a confidential 
co-operationwith you in execution of a deal hereunder for the benefit of
all 
parties, and hopeyou will keep it confidential because of the nature of
this business.
Within the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources where I work
as a Director of Project Implementation, and with co-operation
of four other top officials, we have in our possession, an overdue
payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain percentage
of the contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by a
foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced
to the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty-Five Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost
has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance 
unclaimed. 

Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign
contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain good relations
with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies.
As a result we included ours bills for approvals with the co-operation
of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve
Bank of South Africa (RBSA). We are seeking your assistance as
the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed
to operate a foreign account. 

I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that,
should you be willing to assist us in this transaction your share
as compensation will be 25% while my colleagues and I receive 70%, and
the balance of 5% for taxes and miscellaneous expenses incurred.
It does not matter whether or not your company does contract
projects of the nature described here. The assumption is that
your company won the major contract and subcontracted it to other
companies. More often than not, big trading companies and firms
of unrelated fields wins major contracts and subcontract to more
specialized firms for execution. 

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my
 e-mail address above,to indicate whether or not you are interested in this
deal. If
you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner
to carry out this deal.I want to assure you that my partners
and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim
possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and
guarantee that our share will be secured.It is important that
you treat this matter with utmost confidentiality as any form
of exposure will negatively affect us since we are still in active
Government Service. 

Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful
execution of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in
you and hope that you will not disappoint us. 

Kindly notify me for further details, upon your acceptance
of this proposal. 

Regards, 

Engr.Makalele Johnson

Dear Sir,

I am Mr.Tambo, a native of Cape Town in South Africa and I am an Executive Accountant with the South Africa Department of Mining & Natural Resources. First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium. Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council (SEPC) who was at the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable credentials/particulars to me. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as an Executive Accountant and with the cooperation of four other top officials, we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Twenty - Six Million, Five Hundred Thousand U. S. Dollars ($26,500,000.) which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and cooperation of a foreign company/individual to receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable foreign non-company account to receive such funds. More so, we are handicapped in the circumstances, as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $26.5m represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately. Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor, leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Telegraphic Transfer (T.T) to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Justice Ministry here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you, hence provide me with your private/direct fax number for the form to be send across to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction, your share of the sum will be 25% of the $26,.5 million, 70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses. The business itself is 100% safe, on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction. I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me. Endeavor to contact me immediately through my above Tel/Fax number or 
my e-mail address, whether or not you are interested in this deal. If you are not, it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong Assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter as very confidential matter, because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service and remember once again that time is of the essence in this business.
I wait in anticipation of your fullest co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. Tambo

REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE.

Grace, Peace And Love From This Part Of Atlantic To
You

I must sincerely solicit your strictest confidence in
this transaction, this is by virtue of it's nature as
being utterly confidential and top secret. What I
am about to divulge to you in this mail is top
secret and if it offends or does not meet with your
business ethics, I crave your indulgence.

 I am George Ineh a member of a special committee
set up by the present civilian Government of
Nigeria. We are saddled with the task of auditing the
Accounts of government parastatals and ministries for
the last ten years.

In the course of our work at the committee, we discovered
this fund which resulted from gross re-valuation of
contracts by top government officials of the last
Administration. The companies that executed the
Contracts have been duly paid and the contracts
Commissioned leaving the sum of US$15.6 Million
floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of
Nigeria ready for payment.

I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by
my colleagues in the committee to look for an overseas
partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$15.6M
Legally subcontracting the entitlement to you/your
company. This is bearing in mind that our civil
service code of conduct forbids us from owning
foreign company or running foreign account while in
government service hence the need for an overseas
partner.

We have agreed that the funds will be shared after it
has been paid into your nominated account based on
each parties negotiation upon your acceptance and
willingness to assist us in this transaction. We have
also agreed that our own share of the fund will be
used for importation business in conjunction with you
as we can not bring back cash to Nigeria.

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction
within ten to fourteen days of commencement after
receipt of the following information: Your full
name/ company name, address, company's details &
activities, telephone & fax numbers.

These information will enable us make the applications
and lodge claims to the concerned ministries &
agencies in favor of your company and it is pertinent
to state here that this transaction is entirely based
on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque
drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria
correspondent bankers in America, Asia and Europe is
going to be made in your name. In order to move forward
quickly, please respond to me by Tel:234 17767344,
American Internet Fax:1775-307-0634
(This number was acquired for confidentiality) so I can
 bring you into the complete picture of this pending
project and provide more information as to the successful conclusion of
this project. The best response, however, would be by telephone,
so we can discuss fully all issues
needed to complete this venture in good time, and
successfully.

I await your prompt and positive response to this
business proposal thank you and God bless.

Yours Faithfully,

DR George Ineh.

ATTN:
            URGENT ASSISTANCE NEEDED
You may be surprise to receive this Email from me since you do not know me
personally.
However, I would like to introduce myself. I am Michael Stevens Junior, the
son of Doctor. Simon Stevens. Who was murdered few months ago in Zimbabwe,
as a result of land dispute? Before the death of my father (Dr. Stevens), he
had taken me to Amsterdam and deposit the sum of Fifteen Million United
States dollars (US$15,000,000) in a security company, as he foresaw the
looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money in question was deposited in a box as
Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company. The proposed
amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the
farms and establishment of new farms on Swaziland. As you may be aware this
land problem came into force when Zimbabwe president Mr. Robert Mugabe
Introduced the Land Reformed Act of which my father rich farmers and some
black farmers where affected. This resulted to the killing and Mob action by
Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society, a lot of people were
killed because of this Land reformed act of which my dad was one of the
victims. It is against this background that my family and Iaugustim who are
currently staying in Amsterdam decided to transfer my father's money to a
foreign account. Since the Dutch law prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to
open any account or be involved in any financial transaction. As
The eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking
a genuine foreign account where the money could be transferred. I am faced
with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in Holland for the fear
of going through the same experience in future since both countries have
similar history. Moreover, The Netherlands foreign exchange policy does not
allow such investment from asylum seekers. I humbly solicit for your
assistance in the following:
1) Pay a short working day visit to Amsterdam the Netherlands so that we see
face to face, Have a table talk that would create confidence in me that the
funds will be safe in your hands and have an agreement from an advocate,
which will be duly and legally sign in his chambers before taken any step in
this transaction.
2) Get the entire necessary document regarding this transaction and claim
the boxes from the security company, open an account in your name with a
local bank here and deposit the money for onward transfer to your designated
account in overseas.
3) Make a good arrangement for investment and do invest the money for me, I
am willing to give you some percentage for your assistance on this, and I
offer you 15%. 5% for any expenses, including your telephone calls and any
other expenses that may arise during this process. 80% would be invested and
you get your wages monthly for managing the funds. Contact me on the above
Email, provide me with your telephone and fax number so we can discuss
further and a chance for you to ask me any question you may have in mind,
while you maintain the absolute secrecy required in the transaction.
Please kindly get back to me with your detail contacts.
Sincere Regards,
Michael Stevens Junior.

Dear Friend,
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is 
necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will crave your 
indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR Ademola Williams 
of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former 
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, 
may his soul rest in peace.
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my 
country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five 
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the 
rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one 
of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in 
Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being 
threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi 
Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other 
Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila.In 
view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist 
us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a 
security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the 
Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through 
normal custom/airport screening and clearance.friends (western countries) who 
suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President 
Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor 
met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in 
your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, 
this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge 
success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires 
a total confidentiality.Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund 
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your 
telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost 
indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your 
Decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and GodBless.

Dear Sir, 

Before I introduce myself, I wish to inform  you that
this letter is not a hoax mail and 
I urge you to treat it serious. We want to  transfer
to overseas account ($35,000.000.00 USD) (Thirty Five
Million United States Dollars)  from a Standard Trust
Bank Ltd here in Nigeria, I want to ask you, If you
are not capable to  quietly look for a reliable and
honest person who  will be capable and fit to provide
either an  existing bank account or to set up a new
Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an 
empty a/c can serve to receive this money, as long  as
you will remain honest to me till the end for  this
important business trusting in you and  elieving in
God that you will never let me down either now or in
future.  

I am Dr. Muhammad Khalil Hasan, the Auditor General 
of Standard Trust Bank Ltd here in Nigeria.  During
the course of our auditing, I discovered a floating 
fund in an account opened in the bank in 1996 and
since 1998 nobody has operated on this account
again,after going through some old files in the 
records I discovered that the owner of the account
died without a [Heir/WILL] hence the money is floating
and if I do not remit this money out urgently it will
be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account 
is Mr. Robert Chapman a Canadia and great
industrialist.  He was African Area Director of SIL
International, who unfortunately died in the plane
crash of Kenya Airways Flight 431 in Abidjan, Ivory
Coast, January 30 2000.  You will read more stories
about the crash on  visiting this website,
news.airwise.com/airlines/archive/2 000/kenya2000.html
and also in this website,
www.sil.org/sil/news/2000/chapman.html  where
Chapman's company talked about his death in 
the Kenya crash. You shall as well find the pictures
of Chapman and his wife there.   

No other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary
and my investigation proved to me as well that until 
his death he has a Gold/Diamond Consulting firm.I also
found out that their only surviving daughter died last
year. 

The total amount involve is ($35,000.000.00 USD) 
(Thirty Five Million United States Dollars) and we
wish to transfer this money into a safe foreigners
account abroad. But I don't know any foreigner, 
I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this
money can not be approved to a local person here, but
to a foreigner who has information about the account,
which I shall give to you upon your positive response.
I am revealing this to you with believe in God that
you will never let me down in this business, you are
the first and the only person that I am contacting for
this business, so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you the next step to take urgently.  
 
I need your strong assurance that you will never let
us down, me and a key bank official who is deeply
involved with me in this business.  I guarantee  that
this transaction will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of
the law.  The bank official Will destroy 
all documents of transaction immediately we receive
this money leaving no trace to any place.  I will use
my position and influence to obtain all legal 
approvals for onward transfer of this money to your
account with appropriate clearance from the relevant
ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
40% of the total amount, 60% will be for us, I look
forward to your earliest reply. 
 
PLEASE, TREAT THIS PROPOSAL AS TOP SECRET. 

Find in the attachment my Family Picture, to proof 
who I am.

Best Regards 

Dr. Muhammad Khalil Hasan.

Dear Sir,

Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing the sum of USD22,000.000 (twenty two million dollars)inherited from my father's business reserve.

I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family.my father was an agriculturist. He became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white farmers. Before his death, my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and property and decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property of our family since our home was burnt and the farmlands and machines seized;yet the government and it's loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us.

To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 25% of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 35% share for possible help on investing in any reliable venture.

if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed information. if you do not accept my offer, in good fate treat with utmost confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers for more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

DANDLA NGUBE

Dear Sir,

I am contacting you in view of the fact that we will be of great assistance

to
 each other likewise developing a cordial business relationship. As I am
 interested in your kind of business and wishing to invest in your country.



I am Mrs. Maryam Abacha, wife to the late Nigerian military Head of State.
 General Sanni Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 still in office due
to

a
 protracted illness.

I believe you must be aware of the recent face-off between my family and the


 present Civilian Government of President Olusegun Obasanjo who wants all my


 Late husbands foreign bank accounts and assets confiscated because of the
 monetary excesses of my la


te husbands
Military regime.

Currently, within my reach is the sum of twenty-three Million seven Hundred


 thousand United States Dollars (US$ 23,700,000.00) cash, which I intend to

use
 for investment purposes especially in your country. This huge sum of money


 came
 as result of a pay


back contract
deal between my late husband and a Russian firm on our country's Multi
billion


 Dollar Ajaokuta Steel plant/complex. The Russian partners had since
returned


 my
 husband's share of US$23.7Million after his death and lodged it with a
 security
 firm.

Right now the new Civilian Government have revoked all our licenses that
allows


 us to own financial and oil companies and has frozen some of my late
husbands


 bank account in Switzerland and America.

In view of these I acted very fast to withdraw this US$23.7M from the
security


 company's vault well preserved and packaged in {1}trunk box and lodged in a


 private security firm OVERSEAS as Family Deposits (FD) No record ever
existed


 concerning the money


neither is the money traceable by the Government because there is no
documents


 showing that we received the money from the Russians.

However, due to the current situation in the country concerning the present


 civilian Government hostile attitude towards my family, it has become quite


 impossible for me to make use of the money within the country. Thus I seek


 your
 assistance in moving t


his family Deposits (FD) into your account for safekeeping pending my
arrival


 in
 your country for investment purposes.

On your consent, I shall provide you with a POWER OF ATTORNEY to collect
this


 deposit with the security company OVERSEAS on our behalf. Bearing in mind
that


 your assistance is needed in this regards, I propose a commission of 20%
 (TWENTY PERCENT) of the


total sum to you for the expected services and 10% for local and
international expenses if any.

Your urgent response is highly needed so as to start further contact .
I therefore mandate Barrister GREG ADO who is our family Attorney to deal

 with
 you through out this transaction on my behalf.

May I at this point, emphasize the high level of confidentiality which this


 business demands whatever your decision and hope you will not betray the
trust


 and confidence which I repose in you.

Please don't forget to indicate your convenient phone and fax number where
we


 can always contact you.

However, you may need to give me sufficient assurance that you will not sit

on
 this fund when it is finally remitted into your account. Please direct your


 reply of this mail to my family attorney,GREG ADO at gregado@rxpost.net and

discuss with


him towards effective completion of this transaction.

I believe I can trust you and I am willing to accept from you any useful and


 profitable investment proposal advice in your country. or reply me if my
 proposal interest you through my alternative email address:
mcabacha@gawab.com


s.

Remain blessed.

Best wishes,
Mrs. Maryam Abacha.

 BarristerEDWARD SMITH, a Solicitor at Law. I am the
 personal attorney to  william cole a National of
 your Country, who used to work with Shell Development
 Company here in Nigeria

 the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives. Since then
 I have made several enquiries to locate any of my
 clients extended relatives, this hasalso proved
 unsuccessful.

 After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided
 to track his last name over the Internet, to locate
 any member of his family hence I contacted you. I have
 contacted you to assist in recovering the fund valued
 at US$15.4 Million left behind by my client before it
 gets confisicated or declared unserviceable by the
 Security Finance Firm where this huge amount were
 deposited.

 The said Security Finance Company has issued me a
 notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account
 confisicated within the next twenty one official
 working days. Since I have been unsuccesfull in
 locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek
 the consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the
 deceased since you bear his last names, so that the
 proceeds of this account can be paid to you.

 Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we
 shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities
 for transfer. I have all necessary information and
 legal documents needed to back you up for claim. All I
 require from you is your honest cooperation to enable
 us see this transaction through. I guarantee you that
 this will be executed under legitimate arrangement

Attn:My dear friend

I am Dr Mike Odey, the Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos=20
Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for=20
you.

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian=20
National=20
Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed)=20
Deposit=20
for=20
twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00(Twenty- five Million=20
Dollars) in my branch. =20

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address=20
but got=20
no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered=20
from=20
his=20
contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that=20
Mr. Barry=20
Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I=20
found out=20
that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next=20
of kin=20
to date has fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry=20
Kelly did=20
not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,=20
including his=20
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is=20
still=20
sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the=20
principal=20
sum=20
at the end of each year. =20

No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,=20
at the=20
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of=20
the=20
Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently,=20
my=20
proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the=20
next of=20
kin=20
to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man=92s labor will not=20
get=20
into=20
the hands of some corrupt government  officials. =20

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names,=20
address, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the=20
necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the=20
next of=20
kin. We shall employ the service of another Attorney for drafting and=20
notarization=20
of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of=20
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will=20
then=20
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of=20
kin. =20
The money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in=20
the=20
ratio=20
of 60% for me, 35% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on=20
either=20
sides during the course of this transaction.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will=20
be done=20
by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the=20
successful=20
execution of this transaction. Upon your=20
response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant=20
documents=20
that will help you understand the transaction better.=20

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this=20
transaction=20
would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your=20
assistance=20
to invest my share in your country. Looking forward to hearing from you=20
soonest.

Best regards,

Dr Mike Odey.

                Strictly confidential.

Office of the chairman 
Contract awarding committe 
Ecowas headquarters 
Lome,Republic of togo.

Attn:

Account provision for usd 9.5m

Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you
asa surprise and if it might offend you without your
prior consent and writing through this channel.

I am George Ugo,The Chairman, Contract
Awardind Committee of the ECONOMIC COMMUNITY OF WEST
AFRICAN STATES ( ECOWAS)with Headquarters in Lome,
Togo.I got your information in a business directory
from the Togolaise Chamber of Commerce and Industries
when I was searching for a reliable,honest and
trustworthy person to entrust this business with.I was
simply inspired and motivated to pick your contact
from the many names and lists in the directory.

After discussing my view and your profile with my
colleagues,they were very much satisfied and deci! ded
to contact you immediately for this mutual business
relationship.We wish to transfer the sum of
USD9.5,000,000.00 (Nine Million Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars only.)into your personal or
company`s bank account.

This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contract
bills awarded by us for the supply of ammunitions,
hard/soft wares,phamaceauticals/medical items,light
and heavy duty vehicles, apperals and other
administrative logistics etc for the ECOMOG in
Sierria-Leone and Liberia during the Peace Keeping
Projects.

This DEAL was deliberately hatched out and carefully
protected with all the attendant lope holes sealed
off.As the Chairman of CAC,I have the cooperation and
mandate of the Financial Director and the Secretary of
the Organisation.We arranged and over invoiced the
contract funds supplied by different companies from
different countries during the crisis. 

It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a
willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to
transfer this money out of West Africa.This is borne
out of our beleif in the non-stable and sporous
political nature of this sub-region.

The original contractors have been duely paid by the
Banque Centrale Des Etats De L`Afrique De L`Ouest
(Central Bank of the West African States)through our
bankers-Societe Generale Banque.This balance is
suspended in the escrow accounts awaiting claims by
any foreign company of our choice.We intend to pay out
this fund NOW as the organisation is winding up its
activities since the aim of returning PEACE to the
countries and the coast has been achieved.

Based on the laws and ethics of employment,we as civil
servants working under this organisation, are not
allowed to operate a foreign account.This is the more
reason why we needed your assistance to provide an
account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping
and our future investment with your comprehensiv! e
advise,assistance and partnership in your country.

It is however agreed,as the account owner in this deal
to allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation,65%
will be held on trust for us while 5% will be used to
defray any incidental charges and cost during the
course of the transaction.

This transaction will be successfully concluded within
14 days if you accord us your unalloyed and due
cooperation.You should provide the followings; 

YOUR COMPANY`S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,TEL
AND FAX NUMBERS.(if available)

THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,ITS ADDRESS WITH TEL,FAX
AND TELEX NUMBERS.

THE ACCOUNT NUMBER

THE COMPLETE MAILING ADRRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY 
WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.

Upon the receipt of this informations,the documents
and approval with the texts will be sent to you for
confirmaton and then forwarded to the organisation for
ratification and subsequent payment.

As with the case of all organised (s! ensitive)and
conspired DEALS,we solicit for your unreserved
confidentiality and utmost secret in this business. We
hope to retire peacefully and lead a honourable
business life afterwards.There are no risks involved.

Reply Asap. 
With Regards.

Austin Dunger.

Attention: Friend,

I am Barrister Vincent Usman a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Mr.
John Anderson a foreigner, who was a contractor to Shell Petroleum
Development Company in Nigeria(SPDC). On the 26th of September 1992, my
client, his wife and their three children were involved in a Plane crash on
their way to Yankari Games Reserve for 2week`s holiday.

Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the plane crash, Since then I
have made several enquiries to his Embassy and the home address he filled
in his file in my office to locate any of his extended relatives, this has
also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I
decided to use the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no
avail, hence I contacted you.

I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable
by the SECURITY & FINANCE HOUSE where this fund is deposited. Particularly,
the FINANCE HOUSE where the deceased had an account valued at about US$9M
(Nine million dollars). Conseqently, the bank issued me a notice to provide
the next of kin or have the account confiscated.

since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 10 years
now. I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased
since you are a foreigner so that the proceeds of this account valued at
US$9M can be paid to you and I. We shall share the money thus 55% to me and
40% to you, while 5% will be used to re-imburse any expenses that might be
incurred on both ends and to service the tax that might incur be in your
country.

I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any
claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us
seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

Yours Faithfully,

Barrister Vincent Usman(Esq).

N.B. Please indicate your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication
in this mutual transaction.

unfortunately before such payments could go
through, he died mysteriously in power.

I am writing you for assistance in transfering the sum of US$36.8 million
dollars into your account.This amount represents just a payment due to one
of his friends for a contract awarded to him but was not actually

money intoyour account, this business is totally risk free,it is only
myself that is aware of this floating money.For your assistance,I am

Dear sir,

I am pleased to introduce a business opportunity to you,to transfer to your 
overseas account,sum of,(US$10.500.000m)Ten million five hundred thousands 
United States Dollars) from one of the Prime Banks here in Dakar-Senegal,I 
urgently want to know soonest you,If you are not capable to handle and 
acomodate this magnitude of funds untill i resign and come over to join for 
an investment in your country,tell me so that i can quietly look for another 
reliable and honest individual/organisation that would be capable and fit 
enough to provide either an existing bank account
or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this funds,even an empty 
a/c can serve to receive
this funds,as long as you will remain honest to me till we actualise this 
interest,believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr Mona Noah the Auditor General of one of the prime banks here in 
Dakar Senegal west Africa during the course of our auditing,I discovered a 
floating fund in an account opened in the our bank
since 1982 and till date no body has operated on this account again,after 
going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of 
the account died long ago in a plane crash along with his
family without leaving a[Heir/WILL] hence the funds is floating and if I do 
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.The owner 
of this account is Khalifa T.Ibrahim a foreigner
before his death,he was a management consultant and he died since 1992.No 
other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the 
account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well 
that until his sudden death he was a management consultant.

Since I hardly know any foreigner,I am only contacting you as a foreigner 
partner to stand and apply as his next of kin because this money can not be 
approved to a local person here as his next of kin,without valid 
international foreign passport,but can only be approved to any foreigner 
with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because 
the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner 
too,and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management 
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct 
information of this account,which I will give to you upon your positive 
response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with 
instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this 
business.I need your strong assurance that
you will never,never let me down.

With my influence and my position in the bank the bank official can transfer 
this money to any foreigner's reliable account that you can provide with 
assurance that this money will be intact pending on my physical arrival in 
your country for sharing. The bank official Will destroy all documents of 
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place 
and to build confidence you
can call me for heart to heart discussion through my private satellite phone 
which I secured for the security and safety of this business as you know 
that this business is confidential.

At the conclusion of this business,you will be given 35% of the total 
amount,60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might 
have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email address.
you can contact me with:   mnoah12@hotmail.com
Yours truly,

Mr Mona Noah.

Dear Sir.
 
 May I seek your indulgence to introduce my humble 
 self. I am Kokor Mobutu, the son of the late Zaire
 Republic President, Mobutu Sese Seko.
 Before the death of my father, he kept in my custody
 the sum of USD 30 Million ( Thirty million United
 States Dollars ) this money emanated from the sales
 of
 diamonds he made when he was still on the throne.
 
 My father lodged this money in a security company
 outside our country for security reasons and because
 of the political instability in my country. 

 
 My Father introduced me to the security company       shortly before
 his death. He however deposited this money without
 any
 name rather, with coded numbers which is in my
 possession. With my father dead, my life was at
 great
 risk, I therefore had to leave my country under
 cover
 to
 Spain.
 
 Now, I have decided to invest this money in a
 suitable
 and conducive environment. At this point, I now seek
 your assistance to transfer this money to your bank
 account for proper use. 20% of the total money will
 be
 yours after the transfer and 5% for any expenditure
 we
 might incur in the process while the balance will be
 for me.
 
 On the receipt of your positive response to assist
 me
 on this project, all information related to the
 project will be made available to you on request.
 This
 business is 100% risk free as long as the
 confidentiality the business needs is observed. For
 this business to take off, your bank particulars
 where
 this fund will be paid into is required.
 
 You can always reach me on my

Attention:

With warm hearts I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope
This letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to
Receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.
and due to the rate of scam mails being sent around the world you 
might find it difficult to trust anyone,but please do not regrad this mail as =
such as i have all genuine documentsand facts backing my claims,and also a =
reputable security and financial institution in europe is were my funds is =
deposited.

However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this =
transaction(TRANSFER), which I propose with my free mind and as a person of =
integrity.

My name is HAROLD.A.MBEKI, the son of LATE STEVE ZHIRI MBEKI,
One of the most popular farmers from Zimbabwe, who was murdered in the
Land dispute in my country.As led by my instinct, I decided to contact you =
through email, after searching for Contacts via the internet, as it is the =
only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe =
for now. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.

The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a
Business venture i intend to go into as soon as i get out this funds.

Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, and President Robert =
Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white =
farmers and the few rich black farmers,all white farmers were asked to =
surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his =
political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the =
farmers  association and a strong Member of an opposition party that did not =
support the president's idea.

He then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to
Invade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They Killed my =
father and took away a lot of items from his farm.

After the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my
Father Reverened Theophilus Nnamni ,handed us over will documents with =
instructions from my father That we should leave Zimbabwe incase anything =
happen to him.

The will documents have a certificate of deposit, Airway bill confirming cash =
Deposit totalling Twelve million five hundred thousand united state 
dollars. [$12.5m] kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to 
the company (BRITISH INVESTMENT TRUST SECURITY COMPANY (NETHERLANDS) 
that the content is money hence it was deposited as PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

This money was deposited with this Private Security Company for
Safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase
Of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in
Botswana.

This violent and barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of
My beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent lives.I was continually =
threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father
After he was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger
Became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe
With the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from
Australia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left
With his family following this ugly development I have tried to reach
Him but all to no avail.

I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political
Asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because
the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, I have
Contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in
Johannesburg to The affiliate office here in Amsterdam The Netherlands
which they have finally confirmed to me that the funds has sucessfully 
being transfered to their branch office in AMSTERDAM NETHERLANDS.
and that they are waiting further directives from me before they effect the =
transfer tomy nominated bank account.but due to my refugee status its being =
difficult for me moving this Money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a =
refugee (asylum Seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any =
financial Transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable =
Partner and friend, whose account this money can be transferred after the =
consignment,hence your involvement in this venture.and that would be with the =
assistance of Advocate Smith.E.Fevinn
who has his chambers in DEN HAGG,in the NETHERLANDS who has agreed to stand =
by me till my funds is released, after hearing all my ordeal and verifying my =
claims from the security company.

You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big
And brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of
the safe keeping of this money.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist
With arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from
their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred
>From Johannesburg, South Africa to their branch here. The company will
be legally informed of you representing me.

For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can
Choose to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me
Open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into
Partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money
in your country.Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in
Your reply.

I have also set aside 1 % of the total sum $12.5M for all kinds of
Expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
For Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 20% for
Your moral and financial assistance then the balance will be left
in the account here for me.

Please note that this 1% is not with me at the moment but shall be 
deducted from The total contract sum as soon as the money finally hits your =
nominated account.because it is from this i% that i have to settle the =
barrister.

Finally I want you to maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of
This transaction.as i do not want anything that would jeopardise this
transfer,all my life soley depend on this funds to start up a better life as =
i have no one else to fall back to.as i have lost all i have gotten back =
home.You can verify my story at

Asalam alekum,
I salute you in the name of most High Allah. I am Mrs. Maryam
Abacha, the widow of the late Gen. Sani Abacha former military
Head of State who died mysteriously as a result of cardiac
arrest. Since my husband's death, my family has been under
restriction of movement and that notwithstanding, we are being
molested and constantly under watch by the seemingly agent, above
all, our banks account here and abroad have been frozen by the
Nigerian civilian government. Furthermore, my eldest son is in
detention by the Nigerian Government for more interrogation about
my husband's asset and some vital documents. 
Following the recent discovery of my husband's bank account by
the Nigerian government with my son's bank in which a huge sum of
US$700 million and 450 million Dutch Mark was lodged and 6
billion dollars belonging to my late husband was seized by the
government of Nigeria. I therefore wish to personally appeal to
you seriously and religiously for your urgent assistance to
transfer the sum of $25.5 million United States Dollars into your

a prove of the Certificate of Deposit with the telephone and fax
number of the ?security? company in abroad, the name of the head of
operation including the telephone and fax number of the agency
whom help in packaging the consignment. since we can not leave
the country due to the restriction of movement imposed on the
members of my family by the Nigerian Government and my
International pass
port impounded at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport,
Lagos in August 1998 and presently the consignment is incurring
more demurrage and if the government discovered they might seize
the fund (consignment) that was the reason I was advise by our
Family lawyer for the safety of the fund, to look for an honest
and reliable foreigner who is willing to be of assistant to
enable the fund to be transfer to his account while you are
entitled to 25% of the fund while 5% is for any expenses which
might include your phone calls , stationary which must be
deducted before sharing. 
Also, if you accept this proposal, I shall give you the telephone
and fax number of the ?security? company in abroad where the
consignment
is lodge including agency for verification and you shall as well
forward your data including your telephone and fax number to our
Family Lawyer who shall help in the legal documentation to make
you the legal owner of the fund by a prove of an affidavit from
the Federal High Court for a change of fund ownership by me which
my lawyer shall forward with an application to the Court to
enable the court to issue an legal clearance certificate as a
prove that the fund is no longer belong to ABACHA FAMILY but you
as the new beneficiary which will now empowered the Security
company to release the consignment (fund) to you.
Please I will appreciate your quick response weather you accept
this proposal or not to enable me to know the next step of action

Please do not be apprehensive by this mail as I humbly seek YOUR PATIENCE,

I am contacting you in confidence believing that you will not turn down my

the account manager of Mr. Fredrick Coleman, an Australian, who used to be a
civil contractor in Nigeria. In 1999, Mr. Fredrick Coleman was involved in a
car accident along Sagamu express road and unfortunately his live. Since
then I
have made several enquiries through his countrys embassy to locate any
of his extended relatives without successful. 

Hence, I am contacting you to assist in retrieving the money and property
left
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by
this firm.Mr. Fredrick Colemans an account is valued 18.7 million dollars.
The
company has issued me a notice to provide his next of kin or have the
account
confiscated within the three months. Since I have been unsuccessful in
locating
his relatives for over 4 years now. I am therefore seeking your consent to
present you as the next of kin to the Mr. Coleman so that the proceeds of
this
account can be paid to you.

I intend to use part of this money for investment and charity outreach
while we
shall use part of it for our effort. For your assistance you will be
entitled
to 30% and I 65%. While 5% shall be used to reimburse expenses that might
be incurred 
during the process. I have all necessary data to facilitate success.

All I require is your honest co-operation and support to enable us see this
deal through.
I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
will prevent any
breach of the law.

Please, if its okay with you, get back to me at this email

discuss further.

Best regards,
Harrison Bello.

 FROM: DIAKA TSHOMBE 
 
 DEAR FRIEND, 
 
 MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS 
 LETTER MEETS YOU IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM DIAKA TSHOMBE, 
 AIDE  TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF 
 ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 
 (DRC).  I AM WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR 
 PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN 
 NIGERIA. 
 
 I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE 
 CONSIDERING MY PRSENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS 
 A  WAR REFUGEE HERE IN NIGERIA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE 
 THE LATE  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER,  I WAS  INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF 
 US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND 
 LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING 
 DISCLOSED AS FAMILY VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING 
 FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16 
 1997,  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE 
 REBELS  LED BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM 
 KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED 
 TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS 
 THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER. 
 HE  WAS AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO NIGERIA WITH  MY SON PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY  RESIDING AS A  WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE CAPITAL CITY   KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST MY  WIFE  AND MY TWO CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING  THE  REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY. 
 
 THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE 
 AMASSED A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH 
 HOUSES  IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT 
 PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE 
 SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO 
 FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES. 
 I  THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE 
 SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW 
 THAT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH 
 KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER. 
 
 I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY 
 ABROAD  WHERE THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES. 
 THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM 
 KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO 
 INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY 
 RECEIVING THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS 
 MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE MODALITIES FOR 
 THE  CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE 
 THE  HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS 
 DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND 
 CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU. 
 
 IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE 
 PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE 
 CURRENTLY BEIGN MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER 
 MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. 
 I  AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF 
 THE  MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED. 
 
 FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR CONTACT 
 INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND 
 FAX  NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE 
 RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS. 
 
 YOURS SINCERELY, 
 
 DIAKA TSHOMBE.

Hi,

This is Vasil Nanchev. I just wanted to inform you about something
which is really time sensitive. For the first time in 20 years,
America is going to witness the launch of a new nationwide
newspaper. "THE USA TIMES" will launch on Jan. 1 2004, and
the
promotion is on now. You can join for free and bring other members
into the program to get a great residual income for life. They are
promoting it through MLM and paying on 5 levels. This is going to
get huge and people who act now will be earning a lot of money in
the years to come.

Don't waste time and sign-up at
http://www.newsbucks.com/index.php?id=49641 

As soon as you sign-up (for free), just contact me and I will tell
you how to get other people to join the program. If only 10 people
(which could be your friends, family members or co-workers)
sign-up
under you, you can make thousands of dollars every month without
doing any work. It's true! 

I am really excited and I am sure you will be too after you read
the complete details.

Here is the link again ...

Vasil Nanchev

Dear Friend


You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me =
personally. I am the first daughter of the most popular black farmer in =
Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.

 I got your contact through network online hence i decided to write you. =
Before the death of my father, he took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum =
of US$30 Million (thirty million United States dollars), in one of the  =
security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money =
was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from the =
Security Company.

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the =
Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came =
when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe,  introduced a new Land Act =
Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, =
and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans =
and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because =
of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. it is =
against this background that I and my family fled

Zimbabwe to South Africa for fear of our lives.

After which, I traveled to the Netherlands and I am currently staying in the =
Netherlands where i am seeking political asylum and more so have decided to =
transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law =
of Europe prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to =
be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of =
European Union. As the eldest child of my father, I am saddled with the =
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be =
transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking =
everything we have got.

The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced =
with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of my family name for =
fear of going through difficulty in future. Both countries have similar =
political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future =
and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction =
is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do =
for me, is to make arrangements with the security company to clear the =
Consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as i =
have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the =
Netherlands from South Africa.

But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of =
ownership to the consignment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can =
choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account =
for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper =
profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you =
want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all =
kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.

If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money =
while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in any of the country of =
your choice.  while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required =
in this transaction.
I await your immediate reply and God bless.

Best regards,
Hellen Shaka Zuma

NOTE:
ON YOUR INABILITY TO HANDLE THIS TRANSACTION RESPOND TO ME AND INFORM ME SO I =
CAN LOOK FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

FROM THE DESK OF
BARRISTER AKANDE FREDRICK
NIKK PLAZA 5th FLOOR FLAT 4
AWOLOWO WAY IKEJA LAGOS NIGERIA

Dear ,

I am Barrister AKANDE FREDRICK, a solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney
to Mr. Alfred, a national of your country, who used to work with Eagle Cement
in Nigeria. Here in after Eagle Cement be referred to as my client. On the
21st of April 2001, my client, his wife and their only daughter were involved
in a car accident along sagbama express road.All occupants of the vehicle
unfortunately lost there lives. Since then I have made several enquiries
to your embassy here to locate any of my clients extended relatives,

this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts,
I decided to track his last name over the Internet, to locate any member
of his family hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repartrating
the fund valued at US$13 million left behind by my client before it gets
Confisicated or declaredunserviceable by the Security Finance Firm where
this huge amount weredeposited. The said Security Finance company has issued
me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confisicated
within the next fourteen official working days. For the fact that I have
been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek
the consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased,since you
have the same last name with my client, so that the proceeds of this account
can be paid to you. Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we
shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer.

I have all necessary information and legal documents needed to back you
up for claim. All I require from you is your honest cooperation to enable
us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed
under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the
law. 
Best Regards,
BARRISTER
AKANDE FREDRICK(Esq).

My Lordship, 
 
Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I am former Mrs. Fatima Abass Yakubu Idris now Mrs Mary Abass Yakubu Idris, a widow to Late Sheik Abass Yakubu Idris.
 
I am 65years old; I am now a new Christian convert,suffering from long time cancer of the breast. From all indications, my condition is really deteriorating and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six months, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very Severe stage.
 
My late husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the period of our marriage we had a son who was also killed in a cold blood during the Gulf war. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for more than six months and I am so scared about this. 
 
So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by contributing to the development of evangelism in Africa,which is in my place,America Europe and Asian Countries.This mission, which will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Nigeria, Africa where I live presently. 
 
I selected you and your church after visiting the website for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of $2,200,000.00 Million US Dollars to your Church/Ministry for the development of evangelism and also as aids for the less privileged around you.
 
Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Company in Europe and the company has branches,therefore my lawyer will file an immediate application for the transfer of the money in the name of your ministry. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use,than enhancement of evangelism. 
 
Lastly, I want you/your ministry to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is vanity upon vanity.If you have to die says The Lord, keep fit and I will give you the whole of my life. May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you.
 
I awaits your urgent reply.
 
YOURS IN CHRIST, 
SISTER MARY ABASS IDRIS. 
CHRIST LOVE MINISTRY, 
ILORIN, KWARA STATE.

I learnt that many Africans has used the advantage of what happened to us in 
my country to deceive some innocent souls and may be some has even used my 
fathers name because of his purpularity and greatness.But what we all need 
to understand in this world is that everybody will answer for him or herself 
on the last day.

My name is Mr VINO.F.KONI and i am the only son of my parents. Myfather is 
Mr Johnson Koni and my mother is mrs Rose.s.Koni. I am a graduate of federal 
university of science and technology Harare,Zimbabwe and my discipline is 
Agricultural engineering.After my graduation,I decided to work for my father 
as his manager.My father has two big farms that are well known in Zimbabwe 
and has many workers that were working for him.

I managed my fathers farms for two years before we had in my country.I got 
your contact through network online decided to write you to explain my 
situation and request for your assistance.

This crises was as a result of a new land Act reform introduced by president 
Robert Mugabe which wholly affected most white farmers and few black 
farmers.This resulted in the killing and mob action  by Zimbabwean war 
veterans and some lunatics in the society.Infact a lot of people were killed 
because of this land reform act of which my father was a victim.

But before the death of my father,  as if he knew he was going to die 
informed me about the money he deposited with a security and finance firm in 
South Africa.The total amount is twenty three million,two hundred thousand 
POUNDS (M23,200,000,POUNDS) and this money was deposited in a box as germ 
stones to avoid much demurrage from the Security and finance firm. This 
amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the 
farms and establishment of a new farm in Swaziland.

One month after my father's death,I and my mother decided to travell to 
South Africa for our lives and decided to look for a trustworthy foreigner 
who will help us to transfer this money out of South Africa
because we are staying as refugees here in South Africa and refugees are not 
alowed to open bank accounts or involved in any financial transaction in 
South Africa.I have all the documents concerning
this money and what i am seeking for is a genuine foreign account where this 
money could be transferred into without the knowledge of my government who 
are bent on collecting everything that belongs to my father.

All i am looking for is an honest business man or woman, whom I can entrust 
my future and that of my family . I must also let you know that this 
transaction is 100%risk free. If you accept to assist
me and my family all I want from you is for you to make arrangements and 
come to Johannesburg  South Africa, so that you can help me open a 
nonresident account in your name which will aid us in transferring the money 
into any account you will nominate overseas.

If you are willing to help me,I have two options of compasaction for 
you,firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for 
nominating your account for this transaction, Or you can
go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the 
money in your country. Which ever the option you chooses,feel free to notify 
me.

I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses we might 
incure in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a 
partnership I am willing to give you 25% of the money while the remaining 
70% will remain for me and my family.If you are realy capable and willing to 
assist me please contact me immediately through my direct telephone number 
+27-82-679-3775 or this e-mail address with which i have sent you this 
message.

Finally, please treat this matter as urgent as to save my family from much 
expences caused by demaurage being accumulating on daily bases for the money 
in the security company.Thanks for your mutual
co-operation while i wait for your soonest response.Remain blessed.

Yours Faithfuly,
MR VINO.F.KONI
(for and on behalf of my family)

FROM: DIAKA TSHOMBE 
 
 DEAR FRIEND, 
 
 MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS 
 LETTER MEETS YOU IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM DIAKA TSHOMBE, 
 AIDE  TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF 
 ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 
 (DRC).  I AM WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR 
 PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN 
 NIGERIA. 
 
 I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE 
 CONSIDERING MY PRSENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS 
 A  WAR REFUGEE HERE IN NIGERIA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE 
 THE LATE  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER,  I WAS  INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF 
 US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND 
 LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING 
 DISCLOSED AS FAMILY VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING 
 FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16 
 1997,  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE 
 REBELS  LED BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM 
 KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED 
 TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS 
 THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER. 
 HE  WAS AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO NIGERIA WITH  MY SON  PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY 
 RESIDING AS A  WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE CAPITAL CITY 
 KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST MY 
 WIFE  AND MY TWO CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING 
 THE  REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY. 
 
 THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE 
 AMASSED A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH 
 HOUSES  IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT 
 PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE 
 SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO 
 FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES. 
 I  THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE 
 SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW 
 THAT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH 
 KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER. 
 
 I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY 
 ABROAD  WHERE THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES. 
 THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM 
 KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO 
 INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY 
 RECEIVING THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS 
 MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE MODALITIES FOR 
 THE  CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE 
 THE  HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS 
 DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND 
 CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU. 
 
 IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE 
 PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE 
 CURRENTLY BEIGN MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER 
 MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. 
 I  AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF 
 THE  MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED. 
 
 FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR CONTACT 
 INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND 
 FAX  NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE 
 RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS. 
 
 YOURS SINCERELY, 
 
 DIAKA TSHOMBE.

My dear friend,=20

I am DR. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos
Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for
you.=20

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time
(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00
(Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.=20

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address
but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an=20
automobile accident.=20

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a
WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I
therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly
did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.=20

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.=20

According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the
money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody
applies to claim the fund.=20

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to
stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of
this old
man=C3f=C6'=C3?=E2?T=C3f=E2?s=C3,=C2=A2=C3f=C6'=C3,=C2=A2=C3f=C2=A2=C3=A2=
=E2?s=C2=AC=C3.=C2=A1=C3f=E2?s=C3,=C2=AC=C3f=C6'=C3,=C2=A2=C3f=C2=A2=C3=A2=
=E2?s=C2=AC
=C3.=C2=BE=C3f=E2?s=C3,=C2=A2s labor will not get into the hands of some =
corrupt
government officials.=20

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names
and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall
employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the
WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will
then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the
beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us
to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for
settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds
arrive your country.=20

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees
the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested,
please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email
addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you.=20

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and
relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look
forward to hearing from you soonest.

Thanks and regards.

DR. Yetunde Bassey

<BODY>
My dear friend, <br>
<br>
I am DR. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. <br>
<br>
On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. <br>
<br>
Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an <br>
automobile accident. <br>
<br>
On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. <br>
<br>
This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. <br>
<br>
According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. <br>
<br>
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man&#402&#8217&#8224&#8364&#8482&#402&#8364 &#8218&#8222&#402&#8217&#8218 &#402&#8364&#353&#8364&#382&#402&#8217&#8224&#8364&#8482&#402&#8364&#353&#8218 &#402&#8217&#8218&#402&#8218&#8218&#402&#8218&#8218&#402&#8217&#8224&#8364&#8482&#402&#8364 &#8218&#8222&#402&#8217&#8218&#402&#8218&#8218&#402&#8364&#353&#8218 &#402&#8217&#8224&#8364&#8482&#402&#8364&#353&#8218&#402&#8217&#8218&#402&#8364&#353&#8230&#402&#8364&#353&#8218&#402&#8217&#8218&#402&#8364&#353&#8230&#402&#8364&#353&#8218&#402&#8217&#8224&#8364&#8482&#402&#8364 &#8218&#8222&#402&#8217&#8218 &#402&#8364&#353&#8364&#382&#402&#8217&#8224&#8364&#8482&#402&#8364&#353&#8218&#402!

<br>
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.<br>
<br>
A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. <br>
<br>
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. <br>
<br>
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.<br>
 <br>
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest.<br>
<br>
Thanks and regards.<br>

FROM MR FRED KUMA.
REPUBLIC OF BENIN.
WEST AFRICA.
TEL:229 08 69 05.


Dear Friend,

I am MR FRED KUMA, the director in charge of auditing and accounting
section of Continental Trust Bank cotonou republic of benin in west Africa
with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business
transaction that will be very beneficial to both of  us at the end of the
transaction .

During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my department came
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in
a plane crash on the 26th December 1998 on airline transafrik
International with aircraft Lockheed L-100-30 at location Vila Nova,Angola
with registration number S9-CAO and since his untimely death the funds has
been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in
our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this
development.

Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and
partners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and
successful during the time of execution. The said amount was US$24.1M
(Twenty Four million One Hundred Thousand united states dollars).

As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information
through my a friends who works with the Ministry of Information here in
Cotonou-Benin. It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and
capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem.
Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the
bonafide next of kin to the deceased,get the required approval and transfer
this money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and
needed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your
interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this
great business opportunity.

In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in
this country as a civil servant,we  are not allowed to operate a foreign
account and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time
of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it
will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next
of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need
the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due
verification and clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank
where the whole money will be remitted from to your own designated bank
account.

May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I
have made arrangements for a successful arrangement as an insider of the
bank before contacting you.  On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you
will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% will
be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of
transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me and my partners.

Please, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still in
service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with
you.

I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you
confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country
for subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously
indicated and further investment, either in your country or any country you
advice us to invest in.

All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to
champion this transaction with me.

I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible on my personal mobile
phone 229 08 69 05 stating your wish in this deal.

Yours faithfully,

DR FRED KUMA

Good Day,



With warm heart I offer my friendship, and my greetings,
and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will
be surprising to you to receive this proposal from me
since you do not know me personally.
However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this
transaction, which I propose with my free mind and as a
person of integrity.

My name is Wolny Olkusz, the first son of Paul Olkusz,
of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered
in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict,
I decided to contact you through email, after searching
for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with
Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons.

However, I apologize if this is not acceptable to you. The
purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed
assistance in a business venture. Due to the land and
political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President
Robert Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly
affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my
father for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe.



Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business
foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in
major companies. We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit
the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred
thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This
money was deposited with this Private Security company for
safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the
purchase of land, new machines and chemicals establishment
of new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent
Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the
murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives.

I was continually threatened to abandon my inheritance from
my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but
when the danger became unbearable, and I survived two murder
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the
Holland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my
decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security
company from South Africa, has a branch holland and they
have moved the deposit from their office in Johannesburg down here.

I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part
of the money. Since the law of Netherland prohibits a refugee
(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved
in any financial transaction, this is why I am seeking a
genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can
be transferred, hence this proposal to you.You have to
understand that this decision taken by me entrusts my future
and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is
to assist with arrangements to claim the deposit from the
security company from their office in Netherlands,
as it has now been transfered from Johannesburg, South Africa
to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you
representing me. For your assistance, I have two options for you.

Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your
assistance, and helping me open an account for the money
to be deposited here, or you can go into partnership with
me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country.
Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I
have also set aside 1%($145,000,00) of this money for all kinds of
expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
($580,000,00) for Charity donation.

If you prefer to accept the 10or assisting with opening an
account,
then 85%will be left in the account here for me. Please, I want
you
maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this transaction.
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you
in
advance as I anticipate your co-operation.You can reach me on my
direct line which is  31-630-854-650 or via email,
wolny_olkusz@latinmail.com




Sincerely,

Wolny Olkusz.

Asalam alekum,
I salute you in the name of most High Allah. I am Mrs. Maryam
Abacha, the widow of the late Gen. Sani Abacha former military
Head of State who died mysteriously as a result of cardiac
arrest. Since my husband's death, my family has been under
restriction of movement and that notwithstanding, we are being
molested and constantly under ?watch? by the seemingly agent, above
all, our banks account here and abroad have been frozen by the
Nigerian civilian government. Furthermore, my eldest son is in
detention by the Nigerian Government for more interrogation about
my husband's asset and some vital documents. 
Following the recent discovery of my husband's bank account by
the Nigerian government with my son's bank in which a huge sum of
US$700 million and 450 million Dutch Mark was lodged and 6
billion dollars belonging to my late husband was seized by the
government of Nigeria. I therefore wish to personally appeal to
you seriously and religiously for your urgent assistance to
transfer the sum of $25.5 million United States Dollars into your
account in your country which has already been lodged in a Global
crossing Diplomatic ?security? in abroad by my Late Husband and I
have
a prove of the Certificate of Deposit with the telephone and fax
number of the ?security? company in abroad, the name of the head of
operation including the telephone and fax number of the agency
whom help in packaging the consignment. since we can not leave
the country due to the restriction of movement imposed on the
members of my family by the Nigerian Government and my
International pass
port impounded at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport,
Lagos in August 1998 and presently the consignment is incurring
more demurrage and if the government discovered they might seize
the fund (consignment) that was the reason I was advise by our
Family lawyer for the safety of the fund, to look for an honest
and reliable foreigner who is willing to be of assistant to
enable the fund to be transfer to his account while you are
entitled to 25% of the fund while 5% is for any expenses which
might include your phone calls , stationary which must be
deducted before sharing. 
Also, if you accept this proposal, I shall give you the telephone
and fax number of the ?security? company in abroad where the
consignment
is lodge including agency for verification and you shall as well
forward your data including your telephone and fax number to our
Family Lawyer who shall help in the legal documentation to make
you the legal owner of the fund by a prove of an affidavit from
the Federal High Court for a change of fund ownership by me which
my lawyer shall forward with an application to the Court to
enable the court to issue an legal clearance certificate as a
prove that the fund is no longer belong to ABACHA FAMILY but you
as the new beneficiary which will now empowered the Security
company to release the consignment (fund) to you.
Please I will appreciate your quick response weather you accept
this proposal or not to enable me to know the next step of action
and please you can as well use your name or your company name as
the beneficiary of the fund (consignment ) 
Yours Sincerely 
Mrs Maryam Abacha

  PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
       I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr. Harry =

died in the year
2000.
 We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief =
illness that lasted for only
four days. Before his death we were both born again Christians.Since his =
death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my  matrimonial home =
which the Bible is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the =
sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars) with one =
finance/security company in Amsterderm Holland. Presently, this money is =
still with the Security  Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would =
not last for the next three 
months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  stroke =
sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to church =
or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money the way I =

churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensure  =

husband=92s hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don=92t want a =
situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the =
reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know =
where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. =
Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my =
peace. I don=92t need any telephone communication in this regard because of =
my health because of the presence of my husband=92s relatives around me =
always. I don=92t want them to know about this development. With God all =
things are possible.  As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the =
contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland. I will also =

serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful =
all through your life. Any delay  in your reply will give me room in sourcing =

 owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white farmers to surren=
der their farms 
to his party members and their followers.

My father was one of the best
farmers in the country and knowing that he did not support the presiden=
tial
political ideology, the presidential supporters invaded

my fathers farm
burnt down everything, shot him and as a result of the wounds

sustained, he
became sick and died after two days. And after his death, I with

my
younger Brother decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our 

lives 
to South-Africa.

I am MR.TAMBO MOWETE a native of Cape Town in South Africa and Director of Project Implementation with the SouthAfrica Department of Mining & Natural Resources.I apologize using this medium to reach you for a transaction/business of this magnitude but this is due to Confidentiality and prompt access reposed on this medium.Be informed that a member of the South Africa Export Promotion Council(SEPC)who was on the Government delegation to your country during a trade exhibition gave your enviable particulars to me.I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described Hereunder for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep
it as a top secret because of the nature of this
transaction.

Within the Department of Mining & Natural Resources where I work as Director and with the cooperation of four other top officials,we have in our possession as overdue payment bills totaling Eight Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars($8.5M)which we want to transfer abroad with the assistance and
cooperation of a foreign company /individual to
receive the said fund on our behalf or a reliable
foreign non-company account to receive such funds.More so we are handicapped in the circumstances as the South Africa Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us to operate offshore account hence your importance in the whole transaction.

This amount $8.5million represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm which we the officials over invoiced deliberately.Though the actual contract cost have been paid to the original contractor leaving the balance in the tune of the said amount which we have in principles gotten approval to remit by Key tested Telegraphic Transfer to any foreign bank account you will provide by filing in an application through the Ministry of Justice here in South Africa for the transfer of rights and privileges of the former contractor to you.

I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in the transaction,Your share will be 25% of $8.5million,70% for us and 5% for taxation and miscellaneous expenses.The business itself is 100% safe on your part provided you treat it with utmost secrecy and confidentiality,Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the successful execution of this transaction.I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me,Endeavor to contact me immediately through my email address to confirm if you are interested in this deal.

If you are not it will enable me scout for another foreign partner to carry out this deal.I want to assure you that my partners and myself are in a position to make the payment of this claim possible provided you can give us a very strong assurance and guarantee that our share will be secured and please remember to treat this matter very confidential because we will not comprehend with any form of exposure as we are still in active Government Service.

Once again remember that time is of great essence in this transaction,Positive response should be accompanied with your most private telephone and fax numbers so I can reach you immediately with more informations.

Yours Truly,
MR.TAMBO MOWETE.

Karimusesay@BigMailBox.net

Dear sir,

This letter may come to you as a surprise because we have not met. The decision to write you is out of a sincere desire to establish a business/mutual relationship with you. I got your contact through the international trade and commerce chamber (ITCC) in Madrid.

My name is Thomas Sesay Karimu, the son of John Karimu (former secretery of state for mining and industry) who was killed and mutilated by the military junta led by Major Paul Koroma after over-throwing the elected government of President Tijan Kabba. Though, I don't know to what extent you are familiar with events and disturbances in Sierra-Leone but it had consistent features in the BBC, CNN news bulletins. The pressure of war drove my family out of Sierra-Leone into exile in Spain where we have been living under political asylum for three years.

Sadly, my mother died of cancer 4 months ago and was buried in Madrid. Prior to her death, she gave me a certificate of a secret deposit that my father made in a security company in Europe (destination will be disclosed later for security reasons) The money $45,000,000.00 (forty-five million dollars) was deposited as family treasure. He did this with a view to converting it to his personal use at the end of the war but was killed as a result of his opposition to the rebel forces when the conflict intensified. I have however  contacted the security company to confirm the deposit and establish ownership.

Due to the death of my mother and the continued hostility in Sierra-Leone, I have decided to solicit the assistance of an honest and trustworthy person or company that will assist in investing the money. I cannot do it alone due to my present political status and total ignorance of the business world. You will be given a negotiable percentage of the money at the end of the transaction.

If you are honest, trustworthy and interested in the above proposal, contact me immediately through my email address for more details. You must maintain absolute confidentiality in order to ensure success. Please, indicate your personal telephone/fax numbers when replying.

Best Regards,
Thomas Sesay Karimu.

From: J.Rodney chesson jr 
Chesson Family Corporation, 
Liberia. 
email: chesson_joseph@yahoo.com

Kindest attention, I am very sorry for the informal
manner in which this mail is reaching you. This is
necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable
and trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem
strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence
and pray that you take my request very serious.I am
Mr. Joseph Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J.
F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to
1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12
other Liberian Government officials was assassinated
as a result of a military coup that toppled the
government of President William R. Tolbert, Jr. May
his soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family
has always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia.
You can view our family web page below; 
(http://www.chessonfamily.com/chessonfamilypage.htm)
but please do not call me 
on the tel/fax number below as the number is presumed
bugged by the government.

I received information from a reliable source that
described your country as being economically conducive
for investment and her people as transparent and
trustworthy to engaging business, which made me to
write you. As you may want to know and to make you
less curious, I got your email address from an
Internet site that portrayed you in good light. 
Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the
removal of
President Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good
example of a bad leader. The President who needed
support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum
of twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$
28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation
for my late father and solicited for my support. I
quickly made an arrangement with a courier company
here in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset
management company in 
the uk. I did not support
President Charles Taylor because my conscience is not
for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in
Liberia, he placed all the eligible members of my
family under travel watch,confiscated all our
traveling documents and frozen all our account in
Liberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia
and different peace keeping meetings were held and
President Taylor was advised to step down for national
peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles
Taylor flied into exile but the problem we are having
now is that he handed over power to his Vice-President
Moses Blah who is more wicked and dangerous. He was
the person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all
our traveling documents and frozen all our account in
Liberia. That is why I requested for your sincere
assistance pending when a fresh election will be held
here. The main rebel faction Liberians United for
Reconciliation and Democracy (LURD) has vowed to
continue its war if Taylor hands over to Blah. The
rebels are not happy with the above development so
they still continued fighting. 

WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US:I will transfer the
ownership of the consignment /boxes containing the
cash to you and issue you a power of attorney through
my Lawyer. With these document you will lay claims to
the money as my proxy from the company in europe.

The entire operation is risk free since it is only you
and me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the
money after you must have taken the money to your
country where it is save my lawyer will then meet you
in your country to use my share of the money for
investment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is
needed to transfer this fund, I propose a commission
of 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for
the expected services and assistance. Your private fax
and telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy
conclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life
now) urgently. Your urgent response via the above
email address is highly needed so as to stop further
contact. I must use this opportunity to implore you to
exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter
extra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision
while I await your prompt response. Our phone line
both home and abroad are bugged. So dont call me. I
will always call you at my convenient time and in a
conducive atmosphere. PLS REPLY TO  chesson_joseph@yahoo.com

Regards,

J.Rodney Chesson. JR.

     (RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}  
    {ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS)  



Sir.

We want to transfer to overseas (126,000.000.00 USD)
one hundred and Twenty six million United States Dollars) 
from a Bank in Africa,I want to ask you to 
quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable and fit to provide either an existing
bank account or to set up a new  Bank a/c 
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c
can serve to receive this money, as long as you will
remain honest to me till the end of this important
business trusting in you and believing  in God that
you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr Nelson Abia, the Auditor General of a bank in
Africa, during the course of our auditing  I  
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again. After going through some old files
in the records, I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner
of this account is  Mr. Phillip Morris, a
foreigner, and a sailor. He died since 1993
and  no other person knows about this account or any
thing concerning it. The account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Phillip Morris until his death was the manager 
Morris Coy.(pty). SA.  

  
We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six
million [26,000,000.00] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  amount
to your account.

The amount involved is (76M USD ) Siventy Six million United States Dollars, I want to first transfer $26,000,000.00 [Twenty Six million
United States Dollars] from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner. I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to
a local person here without a valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in US
dollars and the former owner of the  a/c, Mr. Phillip Morris was a foreigner too, [and the money can only
be approved into a foreign a/c].

However, we will sign a binding agreement to bind us
together. I got your contact address  from the girl
who operates computer. I am revealing this to you
with belief in God that you will never let me down in
this business. You are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take . Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will bind us
together before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Then,
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you 
are  capable  and will meet up with instruction of  a
key bank official who is deeply involved with me in
this business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official, we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money, leaving no trace to any place.
To build confidence, you can  come immediately  to
discuss with me face to face, after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries
and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email address.


Sincerely,


Mr Nelson Abia.

     (RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}  
    {ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS)  

Hello,
  
We want to transfer to overseas (126,000.000.00 USD)
One hundred and Twenty six million United States Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you to quietly provide either an existing
bank account or to set up a new  Bank a/c 
immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c
can serve to receive this money, as long as you will
remain honest to me till the end for this important
business trusting in you and believing  in God that
you will never let me down either now or in future

I am Mr.Nelson Abia,the Auditor General of a bank in
Africa, during the course of our auditing  I  
discovered a floating fund  in an account opened in
the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files
in the records I discovered that the owner of the
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner
of this account is  Mr. Phillip Morris, a
foreigner, and a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993.
and  no other person knows about this account or any
thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well
that Phillip Morris until his death was the manager 
Morris  Coy.(pty). SA.  

  
We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six
million [26,000.000] upon successful transaction
without any disappoint from your side, we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining  rest amount
to your account, 

The amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and
Twenty Six million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty Six million
United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't
know any foreigner, I am only contacting you as
a foreigner because this money can not be approved to
a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in us
dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Phillip Morris is a foreigner too, [and the money can only
be approved into a foreign a/c].

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
together I got your contact address  from the Girl
who operates computer, I am revealing this to you
with believe in God that you will never let me down in
this business, you are the first and the only person
that I am contacting for this business, so please
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and
fax number including the full details of the account
to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and
to sign a binding agreement that will  bind us
together  before transferring the money to any account
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before
we fly to your country for withdrawal, sharing and
investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine.
because the management is ready to approve this
payment to any foreigner who has correct information
of this account, which I will give to you, upon your
positive response and once I am convinced that you 
are  capable  and will meet up with instruction of  a
key bank official who is deeply involved with me in
this business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never,
never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank
official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's
reliable account which you can provide with assurance
that this money will be intact pending our physical
arrival in your country for sharing. The bank official
will destroy all documents of transaction immediately
we receive this money leaving no trace to any place
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to
discuss with me face to face after which I will make
this remittance in your presence and three of us will
fly to your country at least two days ahead of the
money going into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately
I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive
this fund in your account. I will use my position and
influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with
appropriate clearance from  the relevant  ministries
and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given
35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5%
will be for expenses both parties might have incurred
during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email


Sincerely,

Mr.Nelson Abia,

FROM MISS ZAINAB UBA AND HER BROTHER
ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST
WEST AFRICA.


ATTN ,

It is my pleasure to write you after my seven days fasting and prayers and 
much consideration since I can not be able to see you face to face at first.

Being the first and the only Daughter of my father, late ALHAJI KALWA UBA from
 BETE in Republic of COTE DIVOIRE Africa I am 21years of age. My 
father was limited liability cocoa and gold merchant in ABIDJAN before his 
untimely death after his business trip to SWITZERLAND, to negotiate on a 
cocoa business. A week after he came back from SWISS, he was assassinated 
with my mother by unknown assassins. 

Which my mother died, instantly, but my father died after five days in 
hospital, on that faithful afternoon. I didnt know that my father was 
going to leave me after I had lost my mother. But
before he gave up the ghost, it was as if he knew he was going to die. He 
my father, (may his soul rest in perfect peace) he disclose to me that he 
deposited the sum of $5 million U.S dollars in a PRIVATE BANK here in 
ABIDJAN. That the money was meant for his cocoa business he wanted to 
invest in Abidjan - Cte dIvoire. Though, according to my father he 
deposited the money in his own name . 

He single handed me over the document and logging and verifying 
informations , and instructed me to seek for a life time investment partner 
abroad. 

Now I have succeeded in locating the BANK in here and also confirmed the 
fund is in there , most honest and confidentiality. Now I am soliciting for 
your assistance to help me lift this money out from The BANK to your 
account abroad so that we should invest it in any lucrative business in 
your country. 

I am Waiting anxiously to hear from you so that we can discuss the 
modalities of this transaction, 

Thanks for your kind attention and mutual
understanding.

Best regards

ZAINAB.

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr.Harry Jones who =
worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine yearsbefore he died in the =
year 2000.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a =
brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both =
born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a =
child outside my  matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my
late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$8.6Million (Eight Millionsix =
hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in =
Amsterderm Holland. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. =
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next
three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  =
stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to =
church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money =
the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will
use this fund to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of =
God and to ensure  that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to =
understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don't have any child that will  inherit this =
money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my =
husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don'twant a =
situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death =
hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of =
the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall =
hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this
regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives =
around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. 
With God all things are possible.  As soon as I receiveyour reply I shall =
give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland. I =
will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the =
original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray =
for me because the lord is my shephard. My 
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to =
serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful =
all through your life. Any delay  in your reply will give me room in sourcing =
for a chuch or christian individual for this
same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated =
herein.  Hoping to hearing from you. N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE =

Dear Sir,
My names are  Mac  Johnson  Bonida, I am the inmediate
young brother to Mrs Jewel Charles Taylor of  war
tored country of Liberia-westAfrica, the wife of (Mr
Charles Taylor) president of Liberia.
After a peace deal in Ghana few weeks ago, my sister
called me for introduction of what need to be done
inmediately that her properties are no longer safe. He
asked me to meet her contact in Ivory Coast to arrange
my journey to Eruope. She said  that she had made
contact with a  Security company to move a truck box
containing $30,000,000.00 US Dollars,  Thirty  Million
United State Dollars Only, and that the security
company label the box which the funds are contained in
as a box containing Africa artifacts.
The Company has confirmed the arrival of  this
consignment in their  office in Netherlands.
I left for Ivory-Coast  for my journey to Europe and
at this moment I am in Netherlands but owing to what
is happening in my country this time, my sister can
not do nothing as to Claim the Consignment and she
want this deal to be a confidential transaction, so
she asked me to contact any partner  who could stand
as a beneficiary of this truck box, so that after the
beneficiary must have claimed the box the money will
be channeled into good business investments with low
risk.
She has agreed to give 10% of the total fund to you
for assistance and moving of the fund to your private
account in your country for the purpose of the
investment. While 5% of the total fund will cover your
expense during this transaction, and another 5% for
me. You can contact me if you are interested by my
e-mail address or kindly call me on this Netherlands
telephone number, .
I would be glad if you can help me out to complete
this transcation and transfer this fund into your
private account. Please endeavour to keep this
transaction as confidentail as much as possible
because my Sister and her husband is in trouble over
the war in my country-Liberia.
Your Sincerelly,
Mac Jonson Bonida

n bank, who will assist us in the transfer of the fund. With your coope=

-out for miscellaneous expenses that might be incurred by both parties =

STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL

DR.YUSUFF KADOSO (PhD).

DEAR SIR, 

RE:URGENT BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP/PARTNERSHIP.

First I must solicit your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. 
I am making this contact with you based on reliable information available
to us courtesy of our local chamber of Commerce and Industry, thus we are
convinced that you would be capable of providing us with a solution to a money 
transfer transaction of US$36,400,000.00 (Thirty-Six Million, Four Hundred Thousand 
United States Dollars ).

Source:During the last military regimes here in Nigeria,government officials set
up companies and awarded themselves contracts that were to be paid from the Petroleum 
Trust Fund (PTF) set up by the military regime for the purpose of financing special 
projects and these were grossly over-invoiced.The present civilian government have 
constituted an Interim Management Committe (IMC) with the mandate to investigate all 
contracts awarded as well as carry out debt verification of all claims that have not yet
been paid with a view of settling all legitimate debts owed by the Federal Government 
of Nigeria to both local and foreign contractors before the government wind up the Trust 
Fund.

We as members of this committee have identified a lot of inflated contract funds which are 
presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria. In the meantime, the government has 
already made a budget allocation for the payment of these contracts, but by virtue of our 
Position as civil servants and members of this panel, we cannot acquire this fund in our 
names. I was delegated as a matter of trust by my colleagues to look for an overseas partner 
into whose account we would transfer the funds totaling (USD36,400,000.00) and you will be
 adequately compensated with 25% of the entire sum, hence we are writing you this mail.

The present Civilian Government is determined to pay foreign contractors all debt owed so 
as to maintain an amiable relationship with both the Foreign Governments and Non Government
Financial Agencies and to attract foreign investment into our economy. We have decided to 
include our bills for approval with the co-operation of some officials of the Federal Ministry 
of Finance (F.M.F) and the Central Bank of Nigeria (C.B.N.).

We seek your assistance in providing us the a good company account or personal account into
which we can remit this money, you will be acting as an ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR in this deal, 
the fund will be paid to you.

This we can do by SWAPPING of account information and changing of beneficiary information to
apply for payment. We prepare letters of claims and job description on your behalf, on 
receiption of the following information (your banker's name and address, account number,
your telephone and fax numbers) It is our intention therefore, while having your 
understanding and co-operation to invest 70% of this funds in the importation of 
agricultural and oil prospecting equipment to sub-western region of Africa.
While the balance 5% will cater for all local and foreign expenses incurred in facilitating 
the transfer of this funds. Please contact me immediately you receive this mail by contacting me on
my confidential email address (yusuffkadoso101@yahoo.com) thus signifying your capability and willingness to assist us. 


We are building our trust on sincerity of purpose, mutual understanding and recommendation.

The business itself is 100% safe and fail proof, provided you treat it with utmost 
secrecy and confidentiality and you follow my instructions carefully and religiously.
Your line of specialization does not matter as it cannot hinder the successful execution 
of this transaction. 

Again we look forward to doing business with you and solicit your utmost confidentiality in 
this transaction.

Thank you for your co-operation.

Yours faithfully,

DR. YUSUFF KADOSO.

N.B. The telecommunication system in my country is very poor, please do not be discouraged 
if you have difficulty in contacting me, your efforts will be much appreciated.
PLEASE,DO QUOTE REFERENCE NUMBER (YK/01) IN YOUR RESPONSE.)

MRS. SUSAN SHABANGU
Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy
South Africa.
Website:www.gov.za/profiles/shabangu.htm

Dear Sir,

After due deliberation with my children, I decided to contact you for your assistance in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of US$15.5M ( Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) First, let me start by introducing myself, I am MRS SUSAN SHABANGU, a mother of three children and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy since 1st April 1996 to date under the President of South Africa MR THABO MBEKI. You can view my profile at my website www.gov.za/profiles/shabangu.htm

After the swearing in ceremony making me the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy, my husband Mr Ndelebe Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in 2002. After his death, I discovered that he had some funds in a dollar account which mounted to the sum of US$15.5M with SYNTHEX TRUST SECURITY AND PRIVATE COMPANY.

This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed with the Government of South Africa. Though I assisted him in getting this contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1998 to date. If they discover this money in his bank account, they will confiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definetely affect my political career in government. I want your assistance in clearing this money from SYNTHEX TRUST SECURITY AND PRIVATE COMPANY.

As soon as the fund is cleared, you are expected to move it immediately into another personal bank account in your country. I will see to it that the account is not traced from South Africa. As soon as you have  confirmed the fund into your account, I will send my eldest son with my Attorney to come to your country to discuss on business investments.

For your assistance, I am offering you 4 Million (Four million United States Dollars Only) However, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that you will not elope with my fund. If you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency send me an email. Due to my sensitive position in the South African Government, I would not WANT you to call me on phone or send a fax to me.

All correspondence must be by email to my private email. If you want to speak with my Attorney, that is fine and okay by me. His chambers will be representing my interest with you.All correspondence must be made either to my Attorney Barrister James Ndlovu of kuramo lodge chambers on <jnchambers@justice.com> or send me an email to my private email box on mrs_susan00@yahoo.com or <mrs_susan2@123.com>.
 
I will also like you to give me your contact address of telephone, fax and email to enable my Attorney call or reach you from time to time. Please I do not need to remind you of the need for absolute Confidentiality if this transaction must succeed. YOU MUST NOT CALL ME! If you do not feel comfortable with this transaction,do not hesitate todiscontinue.

Thanks for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to your family.

Yours faithfully

MRS. SUSAN SHABANGU

Dear Friend,
My name is JANG DOO-HWAN, The brother of Mr. CHUN
DOO-HWAN, the former President of South Korea who
seized power in a military coup in 1979 and who ruled
from 1979 to 1987. My brother was pushed out of office
and charged with treason, corruption and embezzlement
of over 21 billion won. He was wrongly sentenced to
death but fortunately AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL stepped in
and commuted the sentence to life. We thank God that
he has finally been released though still under house
arrest in the sense of the conditions of his freedom.
During my brother's regime as president of South
Korea, we realized some reasonable amount of money
from various deals that we successfully executed. I
have plans to invest this money for my children=92s
future in real estate and industrial production.
Before my brother was overthrown, I secretly
siphoned the sum of $20,000,000.00 Million USD (Twenty
Million United States dollars) out of Seoul and
deposited the money with a Security Firm that
transports valuable goods and consignments through
diplomatic means.
I am contacting you because I want you to deal with
the Security Firm and claim the money on my behalf
since I have declared that the consignment belong to
my Foreign Business Partner. You shall also be
required to assist me in investments in your country.
I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will
not sit on this money when you claim it, rather you
would assist me properly.
I intend to give you 20% of the total money if you can 
assist me claim these from the security company.When I
receive your positive response I will let you know where 
the Security Firm is and the Payment Pin Code to claim 
the money which is very important. What I need is for you 
to indicate your interest that you will assist me by 
receiving the money on my behalf in Europe. For this, you 
shall be considered to be the beneficiary of the money. 
The project in brief, is that the funds with which we intend 
to carry out our proposed investments in your country, is 
presently in the custody of a Diplomatic Courier Service Company
in Europe.
I cannot do this myself because I am presently living
in a Western European Country and my Status here is
that of a Political Refugee and moreover I do not want
the Government of my Country to know about
the money because they will believe I got the money
from my brother while he was still in office as
President. Once you confirm the receipt of the money,
I would leave where I am presently located and come
over with my Children to your Country to start a new
life with my Family.
As soon as payment is effected, and the amount
mentioned above is successfully transferred into your
account, I intend to use my own share in acquiring
some estates in your country. For this purpose also,
you shall be my project manager for the properties I
hope to acquire in your country and you will be paid
based on a certain percentage agreed upon by both of
us.
For now, let all our communication be by e-mail
because of the nature of this transaction but for more
details on this transaction you can contact my lawyer
(Bar Harry Fenadez) on this tel number 0031-630-674-930.
It is very important you contact him because he will be
the one to represent me in all legal matters to back this
pending transaction since i cannot move at the momemt. 
Please send me your Telephone and Fax numbers as it
would be better for me to get to you now by any of
this means. This would be for our better peace of mind
before and after these funds are transferred into your
account.
The reason why it took this long to get to you was
because of the Security Firm's agreement with me which
was that my brother must personally sign the Power of
Attorney that would transfer title to the prospective
beneficiary. It was a long wait but it has now paid
off. His excellency, Chun Doo-Hwan does not want to be
personally involved for security and personal reasons.
Your quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank
you in anticipation of your cooperation.
Yours faithfully,
JANG DOO-HWAN

                                 REF:rf/ntl-fgn

Dear Friend,

Please do not be disturbed about this mail as I am
contacting you for the first time through this medium, 
while nursing no doubts that you will be of great 
assistance to this business proposal  I am about 
disclosing to you for our both mutual benefit.


I am Dr. Ken Dikko, the Project Director of
Nitel at the above address.

Following my intentions of owning an offshore
investment, I was urged to  contact a foreigner 
to assist in facilitating the  immediate release 
of $14Million United States Dollars into his/her bank
account to jointly execute my motive of securing 
an offshore  investment. This was because Nigeria's 
civil service code of conduct does  not allow a civil 
servant to own an offshore account or investment
outside the shores of Nigeria.

Sequel to this, I was able to contact a foreigner (Mr.
Jim Walsh) an American based in Nigeria to assist 
with the transfer.  He agreed and we  proceeded 
in procuring all documents necessary to  facilitate the 
immediate release of the funds into his custody using
him as a Project Consultant to the Nigerian 
Telecommunication.

The money was as a result of an over-invoiced contract
on contract  number "ntl-fgn01/ped-98" for the 
procurement, supply  and installation of 
Telecommunication equipment to Nitel regional offices
up to the tune of $52Million United States Dollars. 
It was awarded to a  Swiss Contractor who executed 
the contract and was fully paid i.e $38Million United 
States Dollars leaving aside $14Million United States
Dollars.

Final payment approval was granted on behalf of Mr.
Jim Walsh by the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF) 
to the paying bank while waiting for the payment 
application from him to the bank but he
suddenly died of Cardiac Arrest leaving no 
Next of kin/beneficiary to the funds.

It is as a result of this, that I am contacting 
you to  please stand as the next of kin to Mr. 
Jim Walsh and new beneficiary  to the funds to 
enable the funds to be transfered into your custody.
All documents to back up your claim will be giving 
to you adequately  while a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) will be reached between us to safe
guard our both interest in line of this transaction.

I am willing to compensate you with 25% of the total
funds while the rest 75% will be for me for the 
investments in your country as well as assuring 
you that this transaction is 100% risk free
and legal.

If this proposal is okay to you, please kindly get
back to me to enable  me demand certain informations 
and briefing for the commencement of this transaction.

Please always quote the reference number above in all
correspondences to me while confidentiality should be 
our watch word.

I await your urgent response.

Sincere regards,

Dr. Ken Dikko.

Project Director,
Nitel.

Good Day!
It is with hope that I write to seek your help in this
context. Firstly,let me start by introducing myself
properly to you. My name is Thomas M.Ralph Taylor, the first
son of President Charles Taylor of Liberia. I got your
email address from network directory. I apologize if I
have infringed on your privacy.
You maybe aware, that my father President Charles
Taylor has been embattled by rebel forces in my
country, couple with his recent indictment by U.N
backed tribunal. These issues, have made world
headlines. Visit, www.liberianews.com
Now my father has accepted to quit power and leave
Liberia on the arrival of peacekeeping force which
might be headed by American troops. But the delay in
deploying peace keeping force, has worsen situation in
the country. In spite of this, My country Liberia, is
like a herd of cattle without shepherd. Rebels Groups
are still fighting to oust my father and assume office
as leaders. The rebel who see my family as a threat to
their ambitions, are planning to kill
every one of us when capture.
However, I am a young man who has ambitions and I am
not in any way interested in wars, this is why I
secretly left Liberia for Amsterdam to seek asylum.
Besides, I am using this correspondence to seek and
request your assistance and cooperation in a sensitive
but highly beneficial financial arrangement.
Prior to the Wars and embattlement of my father,
himself and I deposited a huge amount of money in a
security company?s vault overseas on my name. The
funds were arranged into a consignment before
deposited with the security company But, the security
company did not know that the consignment contains
money. Because, The consignment was declared to
contain family treasure and valuables.
The fact that the war persist and we continue to
accumulate huge debts daily as long as the consignment
remains in the security company?s vault, made me
decided to get someone reliable to proceed as soon as
possible to receive these funds
for investment purpose. As a young man, I plan to use
this money to safeguard my future.
It is very essential that you understand the kind of
trust and confidence I want to put in you. This is an
act of desperation on my part, in order not to loose
this money incase of any eventuality. For your
reliable assistance, if willing, I will reward you
with 25% of the money.
As soon as you declare your willingness to assist, i
shall furnish you with the details and information you
will need to accomplish this task. Please, be rest
assured that this arrangement is absolutely risk free
And cannot implicate you in any way. However, I
implore you to handle this matter with urgency, utmost
secrecy and confidentiality for security and safety
reasons, even if you do not intend to execute the
project.
Thank you in anticipation for your assistance in
enabling me achieve this goal. Please contact me
whether or not you are interested in assisting me.
This will enable me scout for another perosn in the
event of non-interest on your part.
Your?s sincerely,
Mr Thomas M.Ralph Taylor

FROM THE DESK OF
 DR.WILLIAM ISIAKA
 FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
 UNION BANK PLC
 MARINA, LAGOS.

          Dear Sir,
          
  Every four years Nigerian Banks transfer to its treasury Millions of dollars of unclaimed deceased depositors funds,in compliance to the banking laws and guidelines.In the majority of cases in reference to my bank,UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC,The money normally runs into several millions of dollars.

Until MR. THOMAS J. WALTERS death,along with his wife,Doris and their two sons Michael and William in a private plane crash,I was his foreign currency denoted bank account manager,with consistent balance in excess of eight digits.Ever since his death and up till this time of writing,no next of kin or relation has come forward to claim his money with us.

 Naturally,as long as the deceased money remains unclaimed,the bank remains richer in free fund with his money.However,with my being in direct charge of bill and Exchange in the foreign Remittance Department of my bank,I am in a position to cause the payment of this money to whoever that presents himself/herself as next of kin or relation of the deceased.It does not matter whether you bear the same name with the deceased,all you have to do is to provide a foreign account which this money will be remitted into.(It could be a virgin account).

 Now,I want you to act as the deceased relation/next of kin to enable me transfer this money into your account. On a succesfull transaction of this $25,600,000 USD(Twenty Five million Six hundred thousand dollars),You will be entitled to 30% as our foreign partner,while 60% will be for me and my partners,the remaining 10% will be for the expenses incurred by me or you during the period of this transaction.

Remember,As soon as this fund is remitted into your account,my partners and I will visit you in your country for the disbursement of the funds and for investment purposes.

If you are interested in this transaction,do the following to enable me commence action-

(1) Act as next of kin or relation of the deceased.
(2) Provide the location where you want the fund to be remitted.
(3) Provide your direct and private telephone/fax numbers for effective communication.
(4) Give immediate reply to my email address:williamisiaka55@123.com

After getting all this information from you i shall immediately contact an attorney who will swear an affidavit/oath that you are the bonafide beneficiary of the fund.
Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

  Best regards,

 DR. WILLIAM ISIAKA

ECONOMIC RECOVERY COMMITTEE,
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT, 
LAGOS-NIGERIA.

						
Dear Sir,

BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$19.2 M (NINETEEN
MILLION, TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS)
& BUSINESS INVESTMENTS PARTNERSHIP.

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in
this transaction, this is by  virtue of it's nature as
being utterly confidential and top secret as you were
introduced to us in confidence through the Nigerian
Chamber of Commerce, foreign trade division. and if
the contents of this mail does meet with your
approval, i humbly crave your indulgence.

 I am the chairman of the Economic Recovery Committe
(ERC) set up by the present civilian Government of
Nigeria to review economic policies of government
parastatals, and find out ways to reduce waste and
maximise revenues allocated to them.

In the course of our work at the ERC, we discovered
this fund which resulted from gross re-valuation of
contracts  by top government officials of the federal
ministry of Aviation (FMA). The company that
executed the contracts have been duly paid and the
contracts commissioned leaving the sum of US$19.2
Million lying unclaimed in the escrow account of the
Central Bank of Nigeria.

Upon interogation of the directors of engineering and
finance, who both happens to be my contemporaries in
the university, they confessed to me in confidence
that they had an agreement with the original
contractor to re-value the original contract by 30%.


This 30% which amounts to USD19.2m was to be their share from the contract, since the original contractor was well disposed towards giving them the conventional 10% kickback. When I now asked them what they intended to do now that my committee has discovered this USD19.2M. They begged me not to disclose this information to the government as they will likely lose their jobs and their family names destroyed. 

I was at at a crossroad, as I did not want my friends to suffer for what other top government officials do and get away with. I discussed with the other two members of my committee and we all unanimously agreed to transfer this fund out and share amongst ourselves.

I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust by
my colleagues in the committee to look for an overseas
partner to whom we could transfer the sum of US$19.2M
legally sub-contracting the entitlement to you/your
company. 

This is bearing in mind that our  civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign company or running  foreign account while in government service hence the need for a foreign partner.

Should this transaction interest you, you are to
contact me on my personal e-mail address, so that I
can brief you fully, and discuss your renumeration for
this undertaking.
 
All logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for the smooth conclusion of the transaction 
within ten to fourteen days of commencement after
receipt of the following information:  Your  full
name/ company name, address, company's details &
activities, telephone & fax numbers.

These information will enable us make the applications
and lodge claims to the concerned ministries &
agencies in favour of your company and it is pertinent
to state here that this transaction is entirely  based
on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque
drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria
correspondent bankers in America, Asia and Europe is
going to be made out in your name.


Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter  using my personal E-mail address.

Yours Faithfully 

Abayomi Davies.

 In order to transfer out (USD 126 M) One hundred and twenty six million United States Dollars) from African Development Bank. I have the courage to ask you to look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important business believing that you will never let me down either now or in future. 

I am Mr. Errol Marshall, the Chief auditor of African Development Bank (ADB). There is an account opened in this bank in 1990 and since 1995 nobody has operated on this account again.After going through some old files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is Mr.Smith B.Andreas a foreigner, and a miner at kruger gold co,a geologist by profession and he died since 1994. No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this company does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is (USD $126M) One hundred and twenty six million United States Dollars. I want to first transfer US$26( twenty six million United States Dollars) from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner.

I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the account is Mr. Smith B.Andreas he is a foreigner too. I know that this message will come to you as a surprise as we don't know ourselves before. We will sign an agreement, but be sure that it is real and a genuine business. I only got your contact address from my secretary who operates computer, with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business. You are the only person that I have contacted in this business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. 

Send also your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face to face or sign a binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive this money into a foreign account or any account of your choice where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your country for withdrawal and sharing and other investments. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-peration to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner, who has correct information of this account, which I will give to you immediately, if you are able and with capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will never come again in my life. I need truthful person in this business because I don't want to make mistake I need you strong assurance and trust. With my position now in the office I can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable account, which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending my physical arrival in your country for sharing. I will destroy all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place. You can also come to discuss with me face to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and two of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account. 

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my position and influence to effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange departments. At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the process of transferring. I look forward to your earliest reply.

My dear friend, 

I am DR. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger  Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. 

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Roger  Scott died from an 
automobile accident. 

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger  Scott did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 

According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger  Scott that the fruits of this old man&#8217;s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. 

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. 

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest.

Thanks and regards.

DR. Yetunde Bassey

NOTE: Get back to me ONLY on any of these email addresses: yet_basey@indiatimes.com, ybassey@ecplaza.net,

DEAR SIR/MA,

REQUEST FOR URGENT BUSINESS ASSISTANCE

After due deliberation with my children, I decided to contact you for your assistance in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of US30.5M Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only)

First, let me start by introducing myself as MRS SUSAN SHABANGU, a mother of three children and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy since 1st April 1996 to date under the auspices of the President of South Africa MR THABO MBEKI. You can view my profile at my website: www.gov.za/profiles/shabangu.htm

THE PROPOSAL

After the swearing in ceremony making me the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy, my husband Mr Ndelebe Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago in 1996.After his death, I discovered that he had some funds in a dollar account which amounted to the sum of US$30.5M with a South African bank which had her offshore House in the CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA

This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed with the Government of South Africa. Though I assisted him in getting this contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date.If they discover this money in his bank account, they will confiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definetely affect my political career in Government.

I want your assistance in opening an account with CENTRAL BANK through my Attorney so that this fund could be wired into your account directly without any hitch. As soon as the fund gets to your account, you are expected to move it immediately into another personal bank account in your country. I will see to it that the account is not traced from South Africa. As soon as you have confirmed the fund into your account, I will send my eldest son with my Attorney to come to your country to discuss on business investments.

SHARING PERCENTAGE

For your assistance, I am offering you 20% of the principal sum which amounts to US$6,100.000.00 (Six million One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) However, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that you will not elope with my fund.

If you agree to my terms, kindly as a matter of urgency send me an email. Due to my sensitive position in the South African Government, I would not WANT you to call me on phone or send a fax to me. All correspondence must be by above mail address.

If you want to speak with my Attorney, that is fine and okay by me. His chambers will be representing my interest at the CENTRAL BANK. All correspondence must be made either to my Attorney Barrister Richard Lithuli, of Lithuli and associates,or send me an email. I will also like you to give me your contact address,telephone and fax to enable my Attorney call or reach you from time to time. 

Please I do not need to remind you of the need for absolute Confidentiality if this transaction must succeed. YOU MUST NOT CALL ME! If you do not feel comfortable with this transaction, do not hesitate to discontinue.

Thanks for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to your family.

Yours faithfully,

MRS. SUSAN SHABANGU Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy South Africa.

Kindest attention,

I am very sorry for the informal manner in which this mail is reaching you. This is necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trustworthy foreign partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I crave your indulgence and pray that you take my request very serious.

I am Mr. J. Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J. F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to 1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12 other Liberian Government officials was assassinated as a result of a military coup that toppled the government of President William
R. Tolbert, Jr. May his soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family has always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia. 

I received information from a reliable source that described your country as being economically conducive for investment and her people as transparent and trustworthy to engaging business, which made me to write you. As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your email address from an Internet site that portrayed you in good light.

Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the removal of President Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good example of a bad leader. The President who needed support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum of twenty-eight million United States Dollars (US$ 28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as compensation for my late father and solicited for my support. 


I quickly made an arrangement with a courier company here in Monrovia and moved the consignment to an asset management company in Europe. I did not support President Charles Taylor because my conscience is not for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in Liberia, he placed all the eligible members of my family under travel watch confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia and different peace keeping meetings were held and President Taylor was advised to step down for national peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles Taylor flied into exile and handed over power to his Vice-President Moses Blah who is even more wicked and dangerous. He was the person that instigated Taylor to confiscated all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. On Tuesday 14th October 2003, Gyude Bryant took office in Liberia as the head of an interim government. Bryant, 54 was by picked b!
 y the warring factions and this step has offered Liberia a new chance to end nearly 14 years of violence. My lawyer approached him as regards releasing our traveling documents and the embargo on our bank accounts but he declined and told us that his priority is disarm fighters and pave the way for elections that is why I requested for your sincere assistance pending when a fresh election will be held here. 

WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US: 

I will transfer the ownership of the consignment /boxes containing the cash to you and issue you a power of attorney through my Lawyer. With these document you will claims to the money as my proxy from the asset management company in Europe. The entire operation is risk free since it is only you and me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the money after you must have taken the money to your country where it is save my lawyer will then meet you in your country to use my share of the money for investment. Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to transfer this fund, I propose a commission of 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and assistance.

Your private fax and telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy conclusion of this transaction (our only hope in life now) urgently. Your urgent response via the above email address is highly needed so as to stop further contact. I must use this opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost indulgence to keep this matter extra ordinarily confidential whatever your decision while I await your prompt response. Our phone line both home and abroad are bugged. So don't call me. I will always call you at my convenient time and in a conducive atmosphere.

Best regards,

J. Rodney Chesson.

From: Mrs Serena Jones

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married
to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Co
ast for nine years before he died in the year
2000.
We were married for eleven years without a child. He died a
fter a brief illness that lasted for only
four days. Before his death we were both born again Christia
ns.Since his death I decided not to re-
marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bi
ble is against.When my late husband was alive he deposited the
sum of$8.6Million (Eight Million six hundred thousand U.S. D
ollars) with one finance/security company in Amsterderm Hollan
d. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company.
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next
three
months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most i
s my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to
donate this fund to church or better still a christian individ
ual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruc
t here in. I want a church that will use this fund to fund chu
rches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and t
o ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made
us to understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don?t have any child that wil
l inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christi
ans and I don?t want my husband?s hard earned money to be misu
sed by unbelievers. I don?t want a situation where this money
will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking
this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know whe
re I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of th
e Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case
and I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone communi
cation in this regard because of my health because of the pres
ence of my husband?s relatives around me always. I don?t want
them to know about this development. With God all things are p
ossible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the
contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland
. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove
you as the original-
beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always
pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoe
ver that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and
truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any d
elay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a chuch
or christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure
me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping
to hearing from you.

N.B-
PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND =
IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY BEHALF AND HE'S VERY UNDERSTANDING AND =
I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR SUCCESS IN JESUS NAME, THE LAWYER'S NAME =
IS GERRY SLY HIS CONTACT PHONE NUMBER IS 00-31-620-668-086.

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
Mrs Serena Jones

BOARD OF TRUSTEES, 
NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION [NNPC]
Victoria-Island,Lagos.
FROM THE OFFICE OF:DR. JEFF MBOMA (MNIM)

Attn: President/CEO.
BUSINESS PROPOSAL: TRANSFER OF US$25.6 M (TWENTY-FIVE
MILLION SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) &
BUSINESS INVESTMENTS PARTNERSHIP
First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this
transaction,this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly
confidential and top secret as you were introduced to us in
confidence through the Nigerian Chamber of
Commerce, Foreign Trade Division.
I am Dr.Jeff Mboma, the Secretary of the Federal Government
of Nigeria Contract Award and Monitoring Committee (CAMC) of
the Nigerian National 
Petroleum Corporation [NNPC].Sometime ago, a contract was
awarded to a conglomerate of Foreign Companies
by my committee on behalf of NNPC, the contract was
over-invoiced to the tune of US $25.6 Million.This was done
deliberately, the over-invoicing was a deal by members of my
committee to benefit from the project, we now desire to
transfer the money, which is presently in a suspense account
of NNPC in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) into an
overseas account which we expect you to provide
We have agreed that the following funds will be shared thus
after it has been paid into your account;
a) 30% of the money will go to you for acting as the
beneficiary of the fund.
b) 10% has been set aside as an abstract projection for
reimbursement to both parties for incidental expenses that
may be incurred in the course of the transaction.
c) 60% to us the government officials (which we wish to
commence an important business in conjunction with you).
I Would Require
a) Name and address of Company/ Beneficiary
b) Proforma Invoice / Letter-Head Paper

The above information would be used to make formal
applications as a matterof procedure for the release of the
money and onward transfer to your nominated account.
It does not matter whether or not your company or you does
contract projects of the nature described here, the
assumption is that you won a major contract and
subcontracted it out to other companies, more often than
not,big trading companies or individuals of unrelated field
win major contracts and subcontracts to more specialized
firms for execution of such contracts.
We have strong and reliable connections and contacts at the
Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and The Federal Ministry of
Finance and we have no doubts at all that this money will be
released and transferred if we get the necessary
foreign partners to assist us in this deal. Therefore, when
the business is successfully concluded we shall through the
same connections withdraw all documents used from all the
concerned government ministries for 100% security.
We want this money to be transferred to the foreign account
which you are going to provide bearing in mind that our
civil service code of conduct forbids us from owning foreign
company or running foreign account, all
expenses regarding the account opening if not already in
existence shall be borne by you, all expenses are however
reimbursable as already stated above on conclusion of
business.
Please acknowledge the receipt of this letter if you are
interested.
I wait in anticipation of your co-operation.

Yours Faithfully,

Dr.Jeff Mboma (MNIM)

The information is so positive as to convince me that you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money transfer of Five million, five hundred thousand United States Dollars.

I am Mr. Duke Nze, 48 years old, also a driver to Late Engineer Duncan Njei, a Canadian National who lived here and was murdered with unknown beneficiaries by unknown gunmen on 15th June 2002 after his inteligent discovery on the Gold mining in Ghana-Africa. Before he finally gave up in the hospital,he made me to understand that he deposited the total sum of Five million, Five
hundred thousand United State Dollars in a nearby country with a security firm and After his death, i was able to locate the documents relating to that deposit with the security company.

I have tried with all possibility to claim this consignment funds from the cargo company but following the principles and procedures of the diplomatic company that i must provide the next of kin to that deposit with the deposit certificate.

I want to be assure of any safe hand and your honesty to assist me as the next of kin to this deposit and then after by sending your Particulars to enable me start off with all the shipping arrangement and forwarding it to the company while you stand for the release of the consignment as the beneficiary, more also, this transaction is 100% risk free since I have the legal document covering this deposit which shall be forwarded to you

Yours Faithfully
Mr. Duke Nze.

Dear friend,
 Compliment of the day, I am JAMES KYARI, The son of late General  Kubwa =
Kyari of the Democratic Republic of Congo.
 My father was a General in the Congolese Army. In his position (My father) =
with the office of the presidentcy during the regime of Laurent kabila, he =
was assigned on a secret mission to source and acquire arms  internationally =
in order to strengthen the Government forces against the rebels, which =
already had the support of Rwandan and Uganda Army.
 Meanwhile, he was still negotiating for the purchase of the arms, he =
received on the 16th January 2001 news of the assassination of Laurent Kabila =
which force him to call off the assignment and deposited the  sum of =
US$12.5M, Packed in a diplomatic case in a private security company in the =
Hague, the Netherlands, though he registered the content as precious  stones =
while the real content is (US12.5M) meant for the purchase of arms for  the =
Congolese Army. My father went home for the funeral of the late president, =
but on  his arrival he was arrested, detained and tortured, unfortunately my  =
father suffer cardiac arrest and died on the 17th of March 2001. However,one  =
of our
numerous visits, my mother and I paid him while in prison, my father  was =
able to reveal this secret to me and advice that i should proceed to  the =
Netherlands to claim the money, he handed me all the relevant  documents that=

will enable me claim the box from the security company.Already, I have  made =
my first visit to the security company and the document entitled to  =
clearthis money is with a finance security company in Holland.
 On our arrival in the Netherlands few months ago, we sought for  political =
asylum; which was granted. My mother and I are making frantic effort  on the =
best way to handle this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised
that we must seek for a trustworthy foreign business partner whom can invest =
this fund in a profitable venture. This we view as the best option because =
our refugee status dose not permit us to operate a bank account, hence we =
seek your assistance and hope you could be trusted.
 I got your contact from the commercial section of the congolese embassy in =
Belgium. Meanwhile, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money =
through your account, Your share for assisting us will be 25% of the =
totalsum, 5% will be use for upsetting all the expenses incurred in the =
courseof concluding this venture and the remaining 70% that will be for me =
and  my family. Also you stand to gain from any investment you might =
introduce us into after the conclusion of the transfer.
 Please keep this confidential until we finalize and get this money into your =
account for security reasons.
 This is my e-mail address you can reach  me:(jameskyari22@netscape.net
 Thanks and GOD bless.
MR, James Kyari

Dear friend, 

I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu 
Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Democratic Republic 
of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this 
letter. This was in confidence considering my present 
circumstance and situation. I escaped along with my 
husband and two of our sons Joseph and Basher out of 
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Cote 
d'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later 
moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later 
died of cancer disease. 

However, due to this situation we decided to change 
most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in 
Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of 
money coded for safe purpose because the new head of 
state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made arrangement 
with the Swiss government and other European countries 
to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in 
some european countries. Hence, my children and I 
decided laying low in Africa to study the situation 
till when things gets better. Like now that 
president Kabila is dead and the son taking over 
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in 
Southern France was confiscated by the french 
government, and as such I had to change my identity so 
that my investment will not be traced and confiscated. 
I have deposited the sum Fourteen Million United State 
Dollars (US$14,000,000,00.) With a security company 
for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate 
your interest that you can assist us in receiving the 
money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my 
son (Joseph) who has the out modalities for the claim 
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing 
this money, but I will not want my identity revealed. 
I will also want to acquire real/landed properties and 
stock in multi-national companies and to engage in 
other safe and non-speculative investments as advise 
by your good self. 

May I at this point emphasize the high level of 
confidentiality, which this upcoming project demands, 
and hope you will not betray the trust and 
confidence, which I repose in you.In conclusion, if 
you want to assist us, my son (Joseph) shall divulge 
to you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where 
the funds are currently being maintained and also 
discuss remuneration for your services.For this reason 
kindly furnish us your contact information,that is 
your personal telephone and fax number for validation 
purpose and acknowledge receipt of this mail using the 
above email address. 

Yours sincerely, 

Mrs. Mariam M. Seseseko.

PETERSON BULINGA
Contracts Award Monitoring Committee.
Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources.
0031 617 664 901
ATTN:,
I humbly wish to solicit for your assistance in a business transaction.
This business proposal I wish to intimate you of will be of mutual benefit
to the both of us and its success is entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a
high level of confidentiality.

I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring committee of
the Zambian Ministry of Mining and Resources. I am seeking your assistance
to enable me transfer the sum of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your private/company account.
The fund came up as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on
behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two
foreign contractors to the tune of US$180,000,000.00 (One hundred and Eighty
Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the
contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of
US$149,500,000.00 (One hundred and Forty-nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars) to our advantage unknown to the contractor. This
contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian
firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is
in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval.

As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law
to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this message to
you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your private/company
account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the
Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of
US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States
Dollars) into your provided account.

On actualization, the fund will be disbursed as stated below.
1. 20% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary
2. 80% of the fund will be for us.

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth
actualization of the transaction within the next few working days of
commencement. For further details as to the workability of this
transaction,
please reach me as soon as possible for further clarification.
Thank you and God bless as I await your urgent response.
Yours Sincerely,
PETERSON BULINGA

Dear Friend,
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.
My name is Dada Abu,a 74years old merchant,in the
U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer
which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in
caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of
medicine, and right now I have only about a few months
to live, according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone not even myself but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,
I was always hostile to people and only focus on my
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more
to life than just wanting to have or make all the
money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to
this world I would live my life a different way from
how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I
have willed and given most of my properties and assets
to my immediate and extended family members and as
well as a few close friends.
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and
so, I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed
money to some charity organizations in the
U.A.E,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any
more. I once asked members of my family to close one
of my accounts and distribute the money which I have
there to charity organization in Bulgaria and
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore , as
they seem not to be contempted with what I have left
for them.
The last of my money which no one knows about other
than my distant relative who is presently in the
Netherlands is the huge cash deposit of 8 million
dollars that I have with a security company in
Amsterdam.
I will want you to help me collect this deposit with
the assistance of my relative and dispatch it to
charity organizations.If you are interested,please
email my cousin at: paulz111@tiscali.co.uk
Yours Truly
Mr.Dada Abu.

My dear friend, 

I am Mr. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. 

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Roger Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. 

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Roger Scott made died from an 
automobile accident. 

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Roger Scott made did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it. 

According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Scott  so that the fruits of this old man&#8217;s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials. 

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country. 

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you. 

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.
 
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest.

Thanks and regards.

Mr. Yetunde Bassey

Dear Friend,
 
After deliberation with my children, I decided to contact you for your assistance  in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of US$15.5M(Fifteen Million,Five  hundred Thousand United States Dollars ).
 
Firstly, let me start by introducing myself as MRS SUSAN SHABANGU, a mother  of three children and the former Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy under the auspices of the President of South Africa MR THABO MBEKI. You can view my profile at my website www.gov.za/profiles/shabangu.htm
 
THE PROPOSAL After the swearing in ceremony making me the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy, my husband Mr Ndelebe Shabangu died while he was  on an official trip to Trinidad and Tobago . After his death, I discovered that he had some funds in dollar, US$15.5 million United States Dollars currently in a coded security company vault in Europe which I now intend to use to establish a profitable business for my children to
enable my children and I start life again.As a result, I am urgently in need of a very reliable investor participant who is not known as my associate,that I could entrust with the pin and certificate of deposit to help me remove the box including Gold and Diamond Platinium since no one name were used in securing the vault. I can not successfully claim it myself as the government searchlight is still on me.Though, I do not know you in person but I still maintain my late husbands theory that business is people and contacts. hence I crave your assistance,you will also Bank and assist me in investing this money with my lawyers approval on project.
 
Finally,more details on the logistics and modalities of the trasaction will  be given to you as soon as I receive your acceptance letter. Do not forget the confidenciality sorounding this transaction, while awaiting for your letter I am calling on the Almighty God to be with all of us . This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he executed with the Government of South Africa. Though I assisted him in getting
this contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I am afraid  that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on contracts awarded from 1990 to date. If they discover that he has this kind of money,  they will confiscate it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this  will definetely affect my status. The money is contained in a strong steel security box in cash and it is presenting deposited with a security firm in Armsterdam- Holland where it is registered as family treasures and valuables for security reasons.In side the box are all documentation for funds.
 
WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO FOR ME .
1.You are to come to Armsterdam ,open a non-resident account in one of the commercial banks where funds will be deposited before finally being transferred to your nominated account overseas(as may be mutually agreed).
2.I have made arrangements to give the transaction the legal cover as overseas  investment.
3. Security storage and demurrage charges have accumulated considerably since my husband death. I am making arrangement to raise money to settle this.It is imoportant that you and my Attoney are together throughout the transaction in Armsterdam, Holland.
4.I would appreciate at the end of the day ,if part of the money is invested  in developing countries like South Africa.
 5.We will need to sign a legally   binding agreement relating our benefits and commitments in this transaction  For your assistance, I am offering you 20% of this fund,Please honesty is the watch word in this transaction .However, you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that you will not elope with my fund. If you agree to my terms,kindly as a matter of urgency, send me an   email. Due to my sensitive position in the South African Government, I would not want you to call me on phone or send a fax to me. All correspondence must be by email to my private email address, If you want to speak with my Attorney, that is fine and okay by me. His chambers will be representing my interest. All correspondence must be made either to my Attornery,or send me an email. I will also like you to give me your contact address of telephone, fax and email to enable my Attorney call or reach you from time to time.
  
Please I do not need to remind you of the need for absolute Confidentiality if this transaction must succeed. 
YOU MUST NOT CALL ME! If you do not feel comfortable with this transaction, do not hesitate to
discontinue. Thanks for your anticipated co-operation and my regards to your family.

Yours Faithfully,

Mrs. Susan  Shabangu
(Former Deputy Minister of 
Minerals and Energy ,South Africa)

Dear sir,
I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country on behalf of the Director of Contracts and Finance Allocation of the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria.
Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the transaction to be strictly as confidential as possible. He further wants his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, until the completion of the transaction. Hence our desire to have an oversea agent.
I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction.
The deal in brief, is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use.
For this you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry. The contract sum of which shall run into US$15.5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent.
Your area of specialisation does not matter in this transaction,all that is required of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist us acquire estates in your country.
As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into youraccount, we intend to use our own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this too, you shall serve as our agent . I will be with you before the remmittance is made into your provided account to allow trust to play a very minimal role until performance is seen.
You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this proposal to me,After which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through.If however, you are not disposed to assist, kindlydelete/detroy this letter in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and interest of personalities involved.
Thank you in anticipation of your co-operation.
Yours sincerely,
KAYODE PHILLIP.

Director, Investments and Portfolio Management,
Royal Accounting and Trust LLC,
Switzerland.
Tel: 41 79 530 99 35
 
 
Dear Sir/Madam,
 
I am the expert director heading Investments and Portfolio Management in the above-mentioned firm in Switerland.
 
I am contacting you in view of an urgent assistance to carry out a pending transaction, which will develop a cordial business relationship between you and me. One of my clients whom I have personally managed his portfolio for 10 years now was a victim of a fatal car crash. His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and a two-year-old son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti Government on one of his fields which oil was discovered and subsequently explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field).
 
All subsequent investigation to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now 
decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as beneficiary to the portfolio of the deceased.
 
The reason why ownership cannot be transferred to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the authorities for giving birth outside 
marriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a substantial part of Late Mr Saud Alkharjs property for her 
and her son.
 
You must be asking where I got your mail address, it was made available to me by a junior director Mrs Cynthia Philips in charge of customer services on request for contacts for investment expansion for a client but she is not aware of this contact. All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running, if you are interested to assist us, all I will do is to incorporate in the old records recognizing 
you as the only beneficiary.
 
The banking law here stipulates that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public department. The need for a foreigner as beneficiary is occasioned by the fact that the deceased was not 
permanently resident in Switzerland.
 
For your assistance, we made up of I, 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti Government pay royalties, accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank 
funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole beneficiary every year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are 
concerned, as they will be going to the surviving wife and child.
 
If you are okay with the above explanations, you may reply us including all your contact telephone and fax numbers so that we may confirm you genuine, after which we will make more information available to you on how we will 
proceed.
 
I must further assure you that this transaction is 100% legitimate and the modalities for this transaction is being handled by top executives which assure a risk free transaction.Kindly visit my firms website at www.royaltrust.com.
 
We await your timely response.
 
Best Regards

Dear Sir/Madam,

Dear friend,

I know you might have received letters like this from the internet and it came to you as a joke or game, but this is real and legal of which I need your urgent response to. 

I am Barrister ALEXANDER AFADIA a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Mr. Adams Kielar  a national of your country who was an expartriate contractor in the Oil industry. On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife and their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagamu - Lagos express road. 

Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident. Since then, I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives but this was unsuccessful. After several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no avail, hence I contacted you. 

I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Bank where this huge deposits were lodged. 
Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about US$35.5M. (thirty-five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United Stated Dollars) has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confiscated. 

Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over three years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since you are from the same country so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$35.5M. can be paid to you and then we can share the money between us. 60% to me and 30% to you,while 10% should be for expenses and tax as your government may require. 

I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please reply immediately if you are interested to enable us discuss further. 

Yours faithfully, 

ALEXANDER AFADIA Esq.

Since the demise of this client customer, I personally have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds of USD$.30 m, [Thirty million United States dollars] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for a foreigner who I can present as the next of kin hence no one has come up to be the next of kin.

And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more Than five years, after which the money will be called into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds after this period. In view of this I got your contact from a business contact enquiry. Note that you do not need to have similar names with the late beneficiary. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon the receipt of your response, I will commence on manipulating your information into the file as the next of kin and I will send you information on how we intend to actualize our objective in a legal manner.

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five banking days, after your claim is established as the certified next of kin to
The deceased.

TELL:234-1-7756759.
E-MAIL:charlsmorgan2@yehey.com




















Dear SIR,
I guess my letter would not embarrass you since I
have no previous correspondence with you.  The
foreign  trade office of the Nigeria Chamber of
Commerce and




















Industry gave me your company's details.  My request
however  centers on mutual collaboration and your
unflinching support to confidentially set-up a
Joint-Venture outfit in your country.




















I hope I  would not regret approaching you in this
matter.




















I am at present working as the Chairman of the Task
Force that is reviewing all previous and present
contract awarded by various ministries in the
country.




















This appointment is from the office of the
Presidency in the Federal Republic of Nigeria.  Since
the appointment took effect from November, 2000.  The
Task Force have jointly discovered some
irregularities  comprising of over invoice contract
values.




















In the   meantime, we have discovered about Nine
Hundred and Eighty  Million United States Dollars
US$980,000,000.00).




















In our respective positions and status, this is an
opportunity to enrich ourselves and our family, as a
matter of fact, this is a timely opportunity
considering the economic situation in this country, we
have agreed to declare only Nine Hundred and Fifty-Six
Million United States Dollars US$956,000,000.00) to
the government while the balance of
(US$24,000,000.00)Twenty - Four Million United  States
Dollars only will be remitted to your
private/company's account.





















We hope to establish a Joint-Venture Business with you
in your country. This money if accepted by you will be
used in financing the cost of equity and other
expenses for the take-off of the Joint Business.We
have set out the machinery to enable us secure the
effective remittance of this fund to your account, if
only you can work with us.It is however noteworthy
that this business is extremely sensitive and must be
kept confidential.




















Furthermore, 30% of the money will be due
for you as compensation for your effort and
assistance, 10% for incidental expenses to be incurred
on the course of transferring this fund while the
rest goes into the Joint-Venture Project.  Please note
that remittance would be effective from 14 working
days on receipt of your Bank Account
details as follows:
1. Bank Name and Address
2. Account Number
3. Beneficiary's name and address
4. Private Telephone/Fax number for easy




















communication  and confidentiality  of this
transaction.




















However, do endeavour to reply me if your capacity
does not meet up our  proposal so that I can




















further more negotiation.




















Best Regards,
 




















DR JAMES MORGAN.

  Dear Friend=2C 

Iam a staff of African Developent bank=28ADB=29=2E I am writing following an impressive information about you through an internet business proposal =2EI decided to introduce this business opportunity to you=2E 
In my departmentn we discovered an abandoned sum of US$16=2EM =28SIXTEEN MILLION=2C UNITED STATES DOLLARS=29=2EIn an account that belongs to one of ourforeign customer who died along with his entire family in november 1998 in a plane crash=2E 

Since we got information about his death=2C we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guideline
s but unfortunately welearnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim and other officials=2E

It is therefore upon this discovery that we decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don't want
this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill=2E 

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained unclamed after four years=2C the money will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund=2E 

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner=2E 

we agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner=2C in respect to the provision of a foreign account=2C 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for =3Bme and my colleagues=2E 

There after we will visit your country for disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated=2E Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged=2C you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indi
cating your bank name=2C your bank account number=2C your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be remitted=2E

 
Upon receipt of your reply=2C I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application=2E I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have b
een made for the transfer=2E 

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter=2E 
 
Trusting to hear from you immediately=2E 
 
Your's faithfully=2C

THE CHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACT
AWARDING COMMITTEE
ECOWAS HEADQUATERS
ACCRA GHANA
WEST AFRICA.

I am Mr.Kazeem Ahmed,the Chairman of ECOWAS contract awarding committee in
ecowas sub-regional head quarter in Accra Ghana, West Africa. In due respect
and
regard, I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be
very beneficial to both of us
at the end of the transaction. During our investigation and auditing in my
department,we discovered a huge sum of money that was over invoiced
amounting $35,000,000.00 and un-recorded for in the books of Accounts.We
discovered that it has been floating since 1997 through 2001 in
international
Bank of Africa Accra Ghana. this is found out to be over influence on
contract
payments and over invoice. Personally the information is kept secret by me
and
my partner to enable the whole plan and ideas profitable and successful
during
the time of execution. As it may interest you to know, I got your contact
through business inquires from the  chamber of commerce here in my country
as I
was making contact for an honest foreigner who will assist me in this
transaction.
Meanwhile the whole arrangements to put claim over this fund, as a payment
of
contract executed since it cannot be withdrawn locally and get the required
approval and transfer this money to a foreign account
has been put in place and directives and needed information will be relayed
to
you as soon as you indicate your interest and willingness to assits us and
also
benefit yourself in this great business
opportunity. In fact I could have done this alone but because of my position
in
this country as a civil servant we are not allowed to operate a foreign
account
and would eventually raise an eyebrow on my
side during the time of transfer. This is the actual reason why it will
require
a second party or fellow, who will forward claim as the
contractor and also present a foreign account where the money would be
tranferred to as a payment for contract executed as it may be after due
verification by designated board.  I would not fail to inform you that this
transaction is 100% risk-free. On smooth conclussion of this
transaction, you would be entitlled to 30% as gratification,while 5% will be
set
aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer
and
also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and
my partners.
Please, you have been advise to keep top-secret as we are still in service
and
intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will
be
monitoring the whole situation here until you confirm the money in your
account,and ask us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing
according
to percentages.  All other necessary information will be sent to you when I
hear
from you. I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish
in
this deal.
Yours Faithfully,
Mr. Kazeem Ahmed
CHAIRMAN ECOWAS CONTRACT
AWARDING COMMITTEE.

CONTACT ME THROUGH MY ATTORNEYS FAX; 234-1-7591936 OR EMAIL

Compliments of the day to you!

I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha widow of the late General Sanni Abacha
former Nigerian Military President who died on active Government
service on june 8, 1998.

I got your contact from the Internet and I do believe you can
help me.

I am contacting you due to the present situation as regards the
undemocratic manner the present administration in my country
(Nigeria) is taking all that belongs to us You may be aware
that this is the usual attitude of leaders especially in Africa
when there is a change of Government. The present Government of
General Olusegun Obasanjo is currently in a face off with my
family in his bid to recover all our money because my Husband is
dead.

They have brought up charges of corrupt enrichmemnt against us.
Unfortunately, he is currently facing same from the National
Assembly right now. I pray he does not get an Impeachment The
law they made is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to
frustrate, humiliate, dismember and widen the scope of hatred for
my family. A personal vendetta by President Obasanjo who was
jailed by my husband's Government for plotting a coup d 'etat
against his administration in 1995.


This highly calculated attempt by this administration plus some
Western Banks through bi-lateral relationship has taken away from
us a whopping amount in Switzerland and Bank accounts around the
World. This rampaging of our Bank accounts abroad have yielded to
the barbaric pressure and just few months ago we were squized
out of another US$395m because the accounts bear our names. This
assertions can be ascertained independently if you wish to
confirm this from a leading newspaper in Nigeria (This Day Newspapers) from
their website at www.thisdayonline.com from the archives section in the
March 10,2001, January 26,2002 and March 18, 2002 editions.

This pressure is taking a great toll on my family and all we ever
owe. You may be aware that my surviving eldest son (Mohammed),
was undully detained without trial untill thursday 11TH of July
2002 one year now that the Supreme Court of Nigeria Ordered his
release and cleared him of any wrong doing as he has been
languishing in prison for the past three and half years. It was on Monday
23RD September last year that he was finally released to us.

Please we wish to solicit your cooperation as a foreigner to help
us receive some family property / (Money) Deposited with a
Security company which is our only hope / source of livelihood
for now. This is a call for you to help receive this money and
put the money into good investments since we are barred from
leaving the Country for now.

According to my estimation in Western Europe and America alone we
still have over US$70M in cash with Security Companies that we
intend to put in your care by getting a trusted foreigner to
handle money for the purpose of investment and safekeeping abroad.

Please Note that you will be expected to deal directly with the
security company with the information and LEGAL POWER we shall
give you to handle the entire transaction. There is demurrage
accrued over time payable to Security Company to enable
collection of the Consignment, since the Deposit we made at the
time of Deposit has since expired. You must also know that CONSIGNMENT WAS
DEPOSITED AS FAMILY TREASURES, ACTUAL CONTENT ON CONSIGNMENT WAS NOT DECLARED
TO SECURITY COMPANY AT THE TIME OF DEPOSIT TO SAFE GUARD IT. If you can
do this, contact my ATTORNEY, BARRISTER ALI KOLOMA Fax; 234-1-7591936 as
you will be well REWARDED. This is however subject to our negotiation and
agreement.

You can contact me ONLY via our family Attorney, Barrister Ali
Koloma, BY email: palmgroovechambers@winningteam.com for security reason and further
 details.

Endeavor to keep this highly confidential. In your response
include your private telephone / fax numbers for easy
communications with him.

My kind regards,

Mrs. Mariam Abacha

FROM THE DESK OF DR. FRANK BELLO, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR,

CONFIDENTIAL
ATTN: 
Compliments of the day and sorry for the embarrassment
my letter might cause you. I am Dr. Frank Bello, the
Executive Director Finance, of the Nigeria National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). 
Because of my position and that of other strategic
officials who are heads in their departments, we have
in our possession since 1997 the sum of US$60M Dollars
(Sixty million United States Dollars) which we amassed
through over invoicing of foreign contracts fully
executed and commissioned with the different foreign
Contractors duly paid their full contract amounts. 
Following the peaceful life ushered in by the current
democratic dispensation in Nigeria, I and my 
colleagues have decided to transfer the sum of US$60
Million into a foreign account operated by a foreigner
for onward transfer into our accounts. I request your
assistance in transferring and safeguarding the sum of
US$60M Dollars for our mutual benefits. 
For assisting us in transferring and safeguarding this
fund, you will be entitled to 35% of the total sum, 
60% belongs to my colleagues and me while 5% will go
for reimbursement of all expenses made by both 
parties. 
It is imperative to note that this transaction is risk
free as my colleagues in the relevant ministries have
perfected all modalities for the successful transfer
of this fund. 
However, we should see absolute confidentiality as our
watchword throughout the course of this transaction
for we are civil servants and will want to safeguard
our jobs, so as to receive our pension, since we have
put in a lot of years on active service for the
N.N.P.C. 
I will not be ungrateful if you can urgently furnish
me with your full name as you want it to appear in the
necessary documents, address, private telephone, fax
and mobile numbers so as to enable us conclude all
modalities associated with the transfer of the funds
for onward transmission into your nominated bank
account because the Central Bank of Nigeria has
authorized the Guaranty Credit Bank of Nigeria to
make payments to all contractors and you will be
included among the contractors by me and my
colleagues.  
Looking forward to hear from you soonest so as to stop
further contacts .
Regards, 
Dr. Frank Bello.

Mr. Laurent Nkono
Contract Award Monitoring Committee
Offshore Payment Office.
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
Tel: + (31)  629 315 463
Fax:+ (31)  645 166 196

I am interested in your partnership in a business transaction. This business proposal I wish to intimate you of will be of mutual benefit to the both of us and its success is entirely based on mutual trust, cooperation and a high level of confidentiality.

I am representing the board of the contract award and monitoring committee of the Zambian Ministry of Mining and  Resources, Offshore Payment Office Amsterdam, The Netherlands. I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your private/company account.

The fund came up as a result of a contract awarded and executed for and on behalf of my Ministry. The contract was supposed to be awarded to two foreign contractors to the tune of US$180,000,000.00 (One hundred and Eighty Million United States Dollars). But in the course of negotiation, the contract was awarded to a Bulgarian contractor at the cost of US$149,500,000.00 (One hundred and Forty-nine Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) to our advantage unknown to the contractor. This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing payment from my Ministry, where our Board is in-charge of all foreign contract payment approval.

As a civil servant still in active government service, I am forbidden by law to operate an account outside the shores of Zambia. Hence this message to you seeking your assistance so as to enable me present your private/company account details as a beneficiary of contractual claims alongside that of the Bulgarian contractor, to enable me transfer the difference of US$30,500,000.00 (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) into your provided account.

On actualisation, the fund will be disbursed as stated below.

1. 20% of the fund will be for you as beneficiary

2. 80% of the fund will be for Us.

All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for a smooth actualisation of the transaction within the next few working days of commencement. For further details as to the workability of this transaction, please reach me as soon as possible for further clarification. Please, email me on receipt of this mail on ndlovu@phantomemail.com

Thank you and God bless as I await your urgent response.

Yours Sincerely,
Mr. Laurent Nkono

Dear Sir,
It is my great pleasure to write you this letter on
behalf of my colleagues. Your information was given to
me by a member of the South African Export Promotion
Council (SAEPC) who was with the Government delegation
on a trip to your country for a bilateral conference
talk to encourage foreign investors. I have decided to
seek a confidential co-operation with you in the
execution of the deal hereunder for the benefit of all
parties and hope you will keep it confidential because
of the nature of this business.

Within the Department of Minerals & Energy where I
work as a Director of Audit and Project Implementation
and with the co-operation of three other top
officials, we have in our possession an overdue
payment in US funds. The said funds represent certain
percentage of the total contract value executed on
behalf of my Department by a foreign contracting firm,
which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of
US$28.500,000.00 (Twenty Eight Million Five Hundred
Thousand US Dollars). Though the actual contract cost
has been paid to the original contractor, leaving the
excess balance unclaimed.

Since the present Government is determined to pay
foreign contractors all debts owed, so as to maintain
good relationship with foreign governments and
non-governmental agencies. We intend to include our
bills for approvals with the Department of Finance and
the South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB). So we are
seeking your assistance to front as beneficiary of the
> unclaimed funds, since we are not allowed to operate
foreign accounts. Details and change of beneficiary
information upon application for claim to reflect
payment and approvals will be secured on behalf of
you/your company.

I have the authority of my partners involved to
propose that should you be willing to assist us in
this transaction your share as compensation will be so
negotiated and agreed upon by both you and we on this
side, before further details will change hands to
enhance our primary objective.

The business is completely safe and secure, provided
you treat it with utmost confidentiality. It does not
matter whether you/your company does contract projects
as a transfer of powers will be secured in favour of
you/your company to settle any legality. Also, your
area of specialization is not a hindrance to the
successful execution of this transaction. I have
reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will
not disappoint us.

For further details, do not hesitate to contact me 
on my confidential email address, or
 contact of one of  my  parthner who is now 

in spain undergoing studies  his name is  frank mthemba,
and his number is 0034-609-133-527



Awating your urgent response.

Mr. MANUEL SISILU

BUSINESS PROPOSAL.

Dear Sir/Madam,

RE: US$50 MILLION / INVESTMENT ADVICE

I am the wife to Ex-Nigerian(president)Head of State Late Gen. Sanni Abac=
ha
who died on the 8th of June 1998. Sometime in 1998 before his death, he
entrusted to me the sum of US$50 (Fifty Million United States Dollars) wh=
ich
we deposited with an organization which I will disclose to you later .Thi=
s
money was meant for the campaign of his self-succession bid. Unfortunatel=
y
he died before actualization of his aspiration.

This amount of $50M entrusted to me by my late husband due to the trust
and confidence he had on for me as his wife.In agreement with the Abachas=

family, I write to solicit your assistance to transfer this sum of $50M
to you for subsequent disbursement between you and us. We are soliciting
for your assistance because the present Nigerian Government are freezing
any bank account traceable to the Late Ex-Head of State's family and rela=
tives.

For your assistance, we have agreed to compensate you with 20% of the tot=
al
sum while 80% is for us.The major part of our share of 80% shall be used
for investment overseas.

Note that this transaction is 100% risk free as we have mapped out strate=
gies
for a successful transaction with the organization, which I will disclose=

to you later.Please Endeavor to keep this transaction absolutely secret.
This transaction is expected to be concluded within 10 working days If yo=
u
are interested.

I would want you to contact me immediately through my private and most co=

TEL: 234-8037269805.

RE-BUSINESS PROPOSAL:TRANSFER OF US$12.4M (TWELVE MILLION FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND)UNITED STATES DOLLARS AND BUSINESS INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIP. 

Dear Friend and Partner,
I solicit your strictest confidence in this proposal. This is by virtue of it's nature as been utterly confidential and top secret as you were introduced to us through the Nigeria Chamber of Commerce Foreign Trade Division. We are top government officials drawn from the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing FMW&H, the Presidency and the Federal Ministry of Finance FMF making up the Contract Review Panel CRP set up by the present administration to review all contracts awarded by the past government.

In the course of our work on the CRP, we discovered grossly over-invoiced contracts which were awarded to foreign contractors. The contract have been duly executed and commissioned but leaving the contract commission US$12.4M Dollars floating in the escrow account of the Central Bank of Nigeria CBN ready for payment.

The funds resulted from connivance between our predecessors and the foreign contractors. The contractors have been duly paid their contractual entitlement US$81M Dollars but leaving the over-invoiced funds US$12.4M Dollars in CBN's escrow account. We are therefore seeking your assistance in the transfer of these funds out of this country by providing your company name and address to be registered as a subsidiary or afilliate of the real company that executed the contract so as to effect the ballance of the funds into your account as part of the executor.
This is necessary as we cannot use the help of a local contractor here since the job was executed by a foreign company. Hence the need for your assistance.

All logistics and modalities are in place to ensure the smooth conclusion of this transaction within the nest 10 to 14 working days of commencement after the receipt of your company name and address as stated above including your telephone/fax numbers for better communication.
These informations will enable us make the application and lodge claim to the concerned ministry and agency in favour of your company. It is pertinent to state here that this transaction is entirely based on trust as the solar bank draft or certified cheque drawable in any of the Central Bank of Nigeria corresspondent bankers around the World is going to be made in your name.

Finally, when the funds hits your account, I and my associates will come over to your country for the sharing purpose as outlined categorically clear below.
(i) US$10M Dollars for us the 3 members of the Contract Review Panel 
(ii)US$2M Dollars for you for acting as the beneficiary of the funds. 
(iii)US$.4M Dollars as an abstract projections for re-imbursement to both parties for any incidental expenses that may be incured during the process of the transaction.
If you are interested, please write or call my direct access line above.
I await your response in this regard.
Your's Faithfully,
Babatunde Pedro.(Engineer/director of Project FMW&H).

Dear Sir/Madam, 

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me, Since you do not know me personally "My Name is THEMBI TENDAI" The purpose of my introduction is that Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum of US6 Million (Six Million United States dollars),in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black Farmers and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father " Mudada Abba " was one of the victims. It is against this back
round that, I and my Mother and three   younger ones fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and I currently staying in the Netherlands in a village called Zwolle, where my family are seeking political asylum and more so I have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. As the eldest daughter of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same experience in future, both countries have similar political history. 

As the Eldest daughter, I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from South Africa.But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly this money I intend to use for investment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction. Or you can go into Partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 10%
of the money while the remaining 90% will be for my investment in your country. Should you which to assist me, please furnish me with your telephone and fax number me with the above via e-mail while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this transaction. 

God Bless, 

MISS THEMBI TENDAI

Kojo Adams, 
Accounting Department, 
EcoBank. 
Cotonou, 
Attn my friend ,  
I am Mr kojo Adams, Auditor, with Accounting
Department,Ecobank here in Cotonou, Benin Republic. I got your
very good name and e-mail address from the online classified
posted on the net.I have decided to contact  you purely on the
personal conviction of trust andconfidence that we can co-operate with one another and do a very
lucrative business for our mutual benefit.The Business I am
proposing to you is in respect of the  sum of US$11,183,000.00
(Eleven Million One Hundred and Eighty-Three  Thousand United
States Dollars Only) deposited in Dollar account with my bank which belonged to Mr Mohamed Saleh
Ibrahim who died on 25th July,2000 in a plane crash, is an Engineering contractor.My bank has made several efforts at 
contacting the family of Mohamed Saleh Ibrahim or his relatives, but all have proved abortive as
he had no identifiable kins men. This sum of US$11.183M has remained unclaimed ever since then and nobody has 
come 
forward as his next of kin. The management under the influence of our chairman and member of the board of directors 
has  
made an arrangement for the fund to be declared unclaimable  and subsequently be turned to the
reserve account of the bank. It is against the background of the  foregoing,that two of my  colleagues and myself in the 
bank 
have decided to contact you for assistance and partnership, for you to stand as
the next of kin to Mr  Mohamed Saleh Ibrahim.

With your permission this fund will be transferred to your private account
abroad as the beneficiary and next of kin to Mr Mohamed Saleh Ibrahim . All proof of claim and necessary 
documentation will be
carefully worked out in your favour and we assure  you of 100% risk free involvement and protection. 
consequently, if you find this proposal acceptable to you and you wish  to assist us, I expect your urgent response and 
upon
receipt of that,we shall discuss and agree on the disbursement and sharing ratio.Let me therefore expect your very 
urgent
response through my phone,or e-mail  addresses. Please endeavour to include your private phone and fax number and 
also 
your private e-mail where available. 
Please keep this proposal very secret and confidential.
Thank you and best regards 
as I await your urgent response.

Dear Sir/Madam,

		HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
Greetings,

This letter may come to you as a surprise but I plead
with you to patiently read through it before making a
decision whether to assist me or not.

I wish to solicit for your assistance in this
transaction, which I strongly believe, will be of
mutual benefit to both of us.

My name is DAVIS TUTU, a branch manger of a
leading bank in South Africa (ABSA Bank), my
colleagues and I wish to seek your assistance in the
transfer of some huge sum of money (USD$35M) into a
foreign bank account.

An American national deposited this money in a fixed
deposit account in the bank, six years ago. The length
of time for the maturity of the fixed deposit was five
years, which expired towards the ending of last year.
Incidentally, MR. JEFF STEVENS, who was the
beneficiary died in the September 11th bombing of the
World Trade Center in America, and he left MR DAVID
STEVENS as the Next-of-kin to claim this money, but
unfortunately he was said to have died of cancer few months after
Jeff's death. All efforts made to trace any known
relations of both proved abortive, and no one has
written our bank in this regard.

All modalities for the successful transfer of this
money into an offshore bank account have been put in
place and we are looking for a trust worthy foreign
partner into whose bank account this fund would be
remitted to and it is in this regard that my
colleagues have mandated me to provide a partner who
will assist us. We have agreed to compensate you with
20% of the total amount if you should accept to assist
us.

If you are interested in giving us the required
assistance, kindly reply this letter stating your
Telephone/Fax numbers for further action. Because of
the secrecy surrounding this transaction, I suggest
that you send a fax me or call and i will contact you
for futher details.

I am looking forward to a favorable reply from you
soon. Feel free to ask any question in this regard.

I remain,

Yours Faithfully,

Davis Tutu

Attention !

Permit me to inform you of my desire of going into business relationship with you. I got your contact information from your country's information
directory during my desperate search for someone who can assist me
secretly and confidentially in relocating and managing my funds. I prayed over it and selected your name among other names due to its esteeming nature and a trust-worthy person that I can do business with . I must not hesitate to confine in you for this simple and sincere business.

I am Mrs Hilda  P. Tomson, the legal wife of the chief security
officer to late major Tomson  Page, My Husband was the former head
of the presidential guard to Mr Charles Taylor the liberia president.
Before the death of my Husband, on may 15th,2003 during an attempt
by the rebels on the life of president C.Taylor, where he was brutally injured and subsequently rushed to the presidential hospital in monrovia where he later died.Before his death,he secretly called me to his bedside and told me that he has the sum of US$17Million dollars (Seventeen million dollars)which he deposited with my name as his legal wife as the beneficiary and next of kin in depositing the fund with a clearing house in European country. The major reason is that the fund was deposited in a Security Company in Europe it was because of the ways the president was ruling the country,that he foresee things might go wrong with him in due course. I am now in cotonou-Republic of Benin as a refugee because i am being sought after by the rebels since my husband was seen as one of Taylor's strong men as they want to wipe out our family.

I am Dr. Usman ali, I am a former special
Adviser on Petroleum matters to the late Head of State
Of Nigeria Gen. Sani Abacha. Because of my strategic
Position in the former Government and also being a
Close confidant of the late Head of State.

I was able to acquire personally the sum of
$12,500,000.00 USD (Twelve Million, Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars only) presently lodged
In Security Company inform of Gold Bars in a security
company here in Nigeria. I did not want the management
of the Security Company to know the content of the
consignments; therefore I registered the content of
the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the security
company believes that what I deposited with them was
Gold Bars
I made this money largely through "CONSULTANCY FEE"
And "Good Faith Fees" paid by foreign Oil companies
Prior to Allocation of Deep Water Oil Blocs and other
Lifting/prospecting Rights (Nigeria is the 6th largest
Producer/Exporter of Crude Petroleum in the World.
As you are probably aware Nigeria is prone to Military
Coups and the resultant Political/Economic Instability
has fueled hyper Inflation, amongst other problems.

I have therefore resolved to invest my money abroad,
preferable in Real Estate Properties and Importation
of Goods from your country for safety and optimum
returns on Investment.

However, straight transfer of this money into a bank
abroad will present two major problems one, the tax
incidence will be too high, as much as 60% of this
money will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a
result of Government deliberate restrictions on flight
of capital Abroad. And also been accused of money
laundering 
and terrorism, The solution is to Courier this money
cash abroad in form of consignment, through Courier
service Company here in Nigeria in
Conjunction with an embassy here in Nigeria, the money
will be packed in a "Diplomatic Bag/Carton" tagged
Diplomatic luggage that will be address to you.

This system is secret and the money is therefore
Untraceable. It is system used by most top Government
officials to remove their fortunes to safety abroad.
I have therefore concluded every arrangements with a
Courier Company in Nigeria to Courier this money
abroad using the courtesy and safety of Diplomatic
Bag. All I now need is an honest partner who can
receive the money on my behalf and help me to invest
as aforementioned. There is absolutely no risk
involved in this transaction as the money will be
delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills.

If you are interested in assisting me, please send to
me by email immediately your preferred contact address
where this money will be delivered to you, upon
delivery, you are to lodge this money in a bank
account and contact me for necessary arrangements for
the investment.
For your help and assistance in this deal, you will
receive 15% of this money in cash or Equity if you
wish to join the proposed company.


I have notified the Security Company where I deposited
the consignments that contained the fund, that I am
moving the consignment abroad and the security company
has since been waiting for my authority for the
consignment to leave my country and move to abroad.
So if you know that you will use this fund honestly as
I have instructed.

and the details will be given to you on how you will
be able to receive the fund in your country through
the security company. You should also forward to me
your telephone and fax number for easy communication
and to fax you the documents concerning the
consignments.
Your prompt response will be highly appreciated.


Best regards

Dr. Usman ali

HENRICH AGAH& ASSOCIATES,
45 RUMUBIAKANI,PORTHARCOURT
RIVERS STATE
NIGERIA. 

Dearest friend,
I am Barrister Henrich Agah, a Solicitor. I am the
Personal Attorney and Legal Representative to "Mr.
Gary Val", a national of your country, who used to
work with Shell Oil Development Company in Nigeria.
On the 21st of April 1999, my client, his wife and
their three children were involved in a car accident
along Abuja Express Road. Unfortunately, they all lost
their lives in the event of the accident. Since then,
I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to
locate any of my client's extended relatives, this has
also proved unsuccessful.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided
to trace a reliable person  over the Internet to
locate any member of his family but of no avail,
hence, I contacted you to assist in repatriating the
money left behind by my client in a Security Company
here in Nigeria.Particularly, the Security Company
where the deceased deposited the two trunk boxes
containing $10 Million(TEN Million United States
Dollars Only) does not know the content of the two
trunk boxes deposited with them. 

Consequently, the Security Company issued me a notice
to provide the Next-of-Kin to claim the two trunk
boxes in their custody within the next ten official
working days.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the
relatives for over 2 years now, I seek your consent to
present you as the next-of-kin of the deceased to
claim the two trunk boxes since you are from the same
country so that the two trunk boxes can be  delivered
to you by the security company.

Upon receipt of the two trunk boxes, I will come over
to your country to meet with you for the disbursement
of the fund, and then you and me can share the money.
60% to me and 40% to you. I have all necessary legal
documents that can back up any claim we may make with
the Security Company. 

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us
see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will
protect you from any breach of the law.
Please get in touch with me by my secured and
confidential e-mail address at hc_agah555@fsmail.net

Goodday,

I am Joseph vaye,the son of late Issac Nuhan Vaye, deputy minister of public

works under President charles taylor of Liberia.

Before the political upheaval in liberia my late father was a good and
close 
friend of president
charles taylor and a member of his inner caucus.But of late when liberia

crisis came up again,with the rebels trying to oust charles taylor out
of 
government and liberia,president charles taylor became very uncomfortable

with some of his loyalists which my late father happened to be one of them

because he had the believe that at the rate at which the rebel group was
 
closing in on him in Monrovia(which is the seat of power)was as a result
of 
the leakage of some vital security information  from his cabinet and he

decided to eliminate some of his cabinet members which my father happened
to 
be a victim.

It started in the name of an uncovered coup and he ordered the arrest of

some of his cabinet ministers
and the Vice President Moses Blah on the 5th of june which my father was

included and some days later we learnt about my father's death alongside

with John Winpoe Yormie, deputy minister of national security.

My mother and i actually knew why my father was murdered because before
the 
political mayhem in
liberia,my late father  and President charles taylor have maintained a
good 
relationship and he has
assisted him in lodging funds from the sales of diamond in different banks

and security companies which my late father also benefited from it until
at 
the wake of rebellious war in liberia my father was not getting along with

President Charles taylor because of his tyranic law which created a breach

in their relationship and with the alarming rate at which the rebels are

advancing into Monrovia to unseat President charles taylor he was no longer

sure of  some of his cabinet members and decided to eliminate
them under the disguise that they were coup plotters

Before the death of my father, at the peak of his relationship with 
president charles taylor,he was able
to accumulate some funds $31,600,000.00 (US$31.6million)which he deposited

with a security company in Ghana from the deals he did for the president.

Basically my mother and i require a trustworthy person that can assist
us to 
retrieve our funds from the
security company in Ghana.Life has been very unstable for us(my mum,my

youngers ones and i) and i would not want to bore you with all we went

through but for the sake of my late fathers death. All the necessary 
documents for the deposit are in my possession I am now a refugee in 
neigbouring african country Ghana due to the fear of been killed by 
president charles taylor and the unrest in Liberia.

Ironically the president of Nigeria  has agreed to grant  president charles

taylor assylum in Nigeria in
order to restore peace in liberia so we are trying to do all  we can at

earnest to retrieve the funds from
the security company and leave West Africa before he eventually comes to

Nigeria.

Upon your response to this mail,i will intimate you on how we can proceed
to 
get the funds from the security company.

Best regards,

Joseph

MR. KALADA HART
ORIENT BANK (NIG.) LTD.
IDUMOTA BRANCH 
LAGOS. - NIGERIA.




Dear Sir,

I am Mr Kalada Hart, Bank Manager of Orient Bank of Nigeria,
Lagos Branch. I have an urgent and very confidential business 
proposition for you.

On September 6, 1997, a Canadian Oil consultant/contractor with 
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Jerry Sheldon
 made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, 
valued at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch. 
Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding 
address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and 
finally we discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Jerry Sheldon died from 
an automobile accident. On further investigation, I found out that 
he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next 
of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that 
Mr. Jerry Sheldon did not declare any kin or relations in all his 
official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. 
This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the 
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each 
year. No one has ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian 
Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the 
ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the 
next of kin to Mr. Jerry Sheldon so that the fruits of this old man's 
labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government official
s. This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full 
names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary 
documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. 
We shall employ the service of two Attorney for drafting and notarization 
of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/
administration in your favor for the transfer. 
A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then 
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. 
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 
70% for me and 30% for you.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be 
done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guaranttees 
the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, 
please reply immediately via the private email address 
below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details 
and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this 
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall 
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply via my email.

Thanks and regards.

Mr.Kalada Hart

Mr. Donga Kabaka.
P. O. Box 241. Sharjah, United Arab Emirate UAE
Email:dongakabaka555@yahoo.com

Dear Sir/Madam

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me
since you do not know me personally. For the purpose
of introduction, I am Mr. Donga Kabaka, the son of Dr.
James Kabaka, a wealthy black farmer/politician in
Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my
country.

The land problem, in our country came when our
President Mr. Robert Mugabe in a bid to win his
re-election, introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly
affecting the rich white farmers and the black farmers
who are members of the opposition (MDC) party. This
resulted in killings and mob action by Zimbabwean war
veterans and some lunatics in the society. It is
against this background that I and my immediate family
had fled Harare our capital for fear of our lives and
are currently staying in a country side of
United Arab Emirate. We are planning to leave
the country and seek political asylum in Europe and we
have decided to move our family wealth to Europe.

We got your contact through the Internet based on our
urgent need for a dependable and trustworthy foreign
partner and hence decided to write to you. Before the
death of my late father, he had taken me to
United Aram Emirate several times and had
deposited the total sum of US$20.5 million (Twenty
million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars),
in one of the private security companies, as he
foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was
deposited in two boxes as Family Treasures to avoid
much demurrage from the security company. This amount
was meant for the purchase of new machines and
chemicals for the Farms and the establishment of new
farms in Swaziland.

As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the
responsibility of seeking a genuine partner that could
assist us without the knowledge of my government who
are bent on taking everything we have got, and the
United Arab Emirate seems to be playing along
with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this
amount of money out of United Arab Emirate for fear of going
through the same experience in future.

We are seeking a partner whom I have to entrust my
future and that of my family in his/her hands. To this
end, we need your assistance to stand as the
Beneficiary of the Consignments in Europe. This is
because we are under restricted movement and watch and
hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose
this fund, which we have worked so hard for. I have a
sufficient CONTACT person at the Security Company in
United Arab Emirate who can help us move this money to Europe
under DIPLOMATIC COVER to another Security Company in
Europe with your details as the Beneficiary. This is
100% legal and will not pass through normal
Customs/Airport Screening.

Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this
fund out of UAE, you can contact me through
my email address with your telephone, fax number and
personal information to enable us discuss further
details. I must let you know that this transaction is
risk free as far as we keep it as confidential as
possible. Thank you and many blessings to you.

Yours Faithfully,

Mr. Donga Kabaka.

Dear Sir,

I got your esteemed address from the internet during my search for a
reliable Individual/company who can jointly handle strictly confidential
transaction with me which involves a reasonable sum of money.

Due to the nature of this business transaction, a neutral person like you is
preferred. For introductory purpose, I am JAMES Momodu Pujeh, The son of
Momdu Pujeh, former transport and communications minister in Sierra Leone
who has been recently convicted for two years for illegally possessing
638.81 carats of diamonds valued at $36,500.

My father was sacked in November 2001 after the Anti-Corruption Commission
alleged that he and my mother had been involved in diamond trafficking in
Kenema, in the eastern part of Sierra Leone. My father won a seat in
parliamentary elections held last year but is expected to resign following
his conviction. My mother, Mary Momodu, is under investigation on a similar =
charges.

You may have heard how a lot of my father's bank account in Switzerland and
North America has been frozen. Following the outlined reasons for
investigation, I am soliciting for your esteemed organization's confidential
assistance to take custody of Thirteen Million, five hundred thousand United
States Dollars (US$13,500,000.00) and also to front for my family in the
areas of business you consider profitable.

These Consignments containing the funds have secretly been concealed and
deposited with a Diplomatic Security firm where it can easily be taken
delivery of by a recommended beneficiary. The consignment containing the
funds will be released to your
organization by the Security firm based on my recommendations on that note;
you will be presented as our partner who will be fronting for me and my
family in any subsequent ventures.

I have made my first visit to the security company and the document entitled
to clear this money is with a finance security company in Holland. On our
arrival in the Netherlands few weeks ago, we sought for political asylum;
which was granted.

Already, my sister and I are making frantic effort on the best way to handle
this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised that we must seek
for a trustworthy foreign business partner whom can invest this fund in a
profitable venture.

This we view as the best option because our refugee status dose not permit
us to operate a bank account, hence we seek your assistance and hope you
could be trusted.
Meanwhile, I sincerely ask for your assistance to get this money through
your account. I and my mother have decided to give 25% to your organization
if you are able to help us claim this consignment. And 5% will be use for
upsetting all the expenses incurred in the course of concluding this venture
and the remaining 70% that will be for me and my family.

Please, I need your entire support and co-operation for the success of this
business ventures, your utmost confidentiality and secrecy is highly
required, due to my family's present predicament. Also you stand to gain
from any investment you might introduce us into after the conclusion of the
transfer. Please keep this confidential until we finalize and get this money
into your account for security reasons.

I am presently in the refugee camp here in the Netherlands under the United
Nations and I can be reached by responding to the following email address:
jamepuj2@zwallet.com
jamepuj@fsmail.net

Kind regards,

Mr. James Momodu

URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL
Kindly allow me the modesty of introducing myself. I
am Gregory Kabila, the son of the former head of state
president of Congo-Kinshasha (then called Zaire) Mr.
Laurent Desire Kabila.
I am contacting you in order to ask for your assistance
on this confidential Business proposal with full financial
benefit for both of us.
Before I go into further details please be informed
that I am writing without any other person(s)
pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this
transaction. Therefore I will appreciate same attitude
to be maintained all through.
I have the sum of USD48Million from a secret sale of
Diamond by my father before he was assassinated by one
of his body guard (Rashid) on January 16th 2001, which
I will like you to receive on my behalf due to
security reasons, as my narration below will explain.
But before I continue be well informed that your share
in this transaction has been calculated at 25% of the
total sum of USD$48M, 5% for expenses and the rest for
my family and me.
My father as a real African traditionalist was a
polygamist thereby having married so many wives, and
my mother being the second wife of my father, My
stepbrother Joseph, who is the current president of my
country, is the son of the first wife and he does not
have any knowledge about this deal.
Already president Joseph is using his power to
colonize all the money and private property, which my
father left behind for the whole family. Now my mother
and I are left with nothing in the inheritance of my
late father=92s wealth. Our situation is seriously
critical that we need your assistance to help us
receive these funds overseas for proper investment.
Let me quickly assure you the 100% safe proof of this
transaction because the diamond sales are packaged
from the onset in a pattern that shows no direct trace
or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present the
money is in cash and is secured in a security company
as family treasures, as I don=92t want to deposit the
money in a financial institution for fear of the funds
being confiscated
The consignment will be released within seven (7) days
of my being in receipt of your reply via my email
address above only for security reasons.
I am waiting for your swift and favorable response,
and in case you have any question(s), do not hesitate
to contact me.
Best Regards,
Gregory Kabila.

Dearly Beloved In Christ,


Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, I am former Mrs. Fatima Adijat Alade, now Mrs.
Mary Abosede Alade, a widow to Late Sherrif Alade. I
am 70years old. I am now a new Christian
convert,suffering from long time cancer of the breast.


>From all indications, my condition is serious and is
quite obvious that I may not live more than six
months,because the cancer stage has gotten to a very
severe state and my doctor has told me this. My late
husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the
period of our marriage we had a son who was also
killed in cold blood during the Gulf war. 


My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I
inherited all his business and wealth. As my doctor
told me that I may not live for more than six months,I
am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide
part of the inherited wealth, by contributing to the
development of evangelism in part of the world. 
This mission which will no doubt be tasking had made
me to recently relocated to Nigeria, Africa where I
live presently. I selected your ministry after
visiting the website for this purpose and prayed over
it, I am willing to donate the sum of
US$10.000,000.00(Ten Million USD)to your Ministry for
the development of evangelism and also as aids for the
less privileged around you. 


Please note that, this fund is lying with a Security
Company and my family lawyer will file an immediate
application for the transfer of the money in the name
of your ministry. 


If you are interested,do contact our Lawyer on the email address below,his name is Barrister FRANK OSAROBO:


email: frankosarobo@email.ro


Please, do not reply me if you have
the intention of using this fund for personal use.


Lastly, I want your ministry to keep praying for me as
regarding my health because I have come to find out
since my spiritual birth recently that wealth
acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is
vanity upon vanity. If you have to die says the
Lord,keep fit and I will give you the crown of life. 


May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of
God, and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit be
with you now and forevermore.


We await your urgent reply. 


Yours in Christ,


Mrs Mary A. Alade
No.1 Sherrif Alade Close

Hello my beloved kind hearted,

 

THIS IS HUMANITERIAN SERVICE THAT REQUIRES YOUR ATTENTION!

 

I simply want to take this occasion to tell you about my intention to =
contribute toward the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS and I need your help =
as my representative overseas. I need you to receive my financial =
entitlements from my financiers overseas on my behalf for the fight against =
Cholera and HIV/AIDS and hope you would not let me down.

 

It might interest you to know that in my supporting role to the Minister of =
Public Works here in Pretoria, South Africa it is my responsibility to handle =
some very intrinsic matters for, on behalf or with the Minister. By my =
duties, it is almost impossible for any file/Contract Proposals to get to the =
Minister for approval, without it passing through my scrutiny.

 

By my religious status and as the South African Deputy Minister of Public =
Works, I have cause to help a lot of foreign contractor-companies (mainly =
American) to secure the release of their entitlements from the coffers of the =
government of South Africa. I did this, principally, as a help to the =
concerned companies, but in appreciation of my efforts, most of them =
committed themselves to paying some handsome monetary honorarium to me. =
However, because of my position as a political appointee, it is impossible =
for me to collect such money immediately or even directly. Hence, I need you =
to collect this money on my behalf and use it as you would be further =
directed for the fight against Cholera and HIV/AIDS. Of course your effort =
will not be in vain. You would be well rewarded for your help in this =
regards.

 

All the money from the various companies put together is totaling amount to =
Eight Hundred and Fifty Five Thousand United States Dollars (US$855,000) =
only. The snag is that I just discovered that I couldn't collect this money, =
directly, from these companies in my name or the name of any of my family =
members, because government will investigate "why?" and "what for? Therefore, =
to forestall any such problems, I decided to contact you through this secured =
and private medium, to solicit your assistance in this regard.

 

You will receive this money on my behalf, and use it as you would be further =
directed. That way, there will be no link between the companies and me. I =
will instruct the concerned companies to make the money available to you on =
installment either via swift means or by cheque as you so desire of not more =
than $75,000, as the case may be.

 

>From the money you receive on my behalf, you would be entitled to retaining =
10% of the sum while you would be required to wire the balance 90% for its =
purpose of humanitarian services as would be advised. For example, if you =
receive $75,000, you would be required to retain 10% ($7,500) while you wire =
the balance $67,500 for its purpose. This is basically on trust. It is a =
simple job you do for me and all expenses for the cost of transfer of funds =
would be from the 90% and you will not spend a single cent from your money to =
actualize this project. No financial commitment from you and it's simple and =
risk free. You receive the money on my behalf, take away your 10% and =
redirect the remaining 90% as would be instructed. I can assure you that if =
you keep to our agreement, this will be the beginning of a mutually =
beneficial relationship between the two of us. Afterward, there are a lot of =
other things we can do together that will fetch you a fortune.

 

If you are interested and would like to work with me for the fight against =
Cholera and HIV/AIDS, I would need you to provide me with the following:

 

(1) IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY SWIFT MEANS:

Provide me with:

a). Name of your bank.

b) Address of your bank.

c) Bank Telephone and Fax.

d) Account Number.

e) Swift Code/Routing Number.

d)Account Names.

 

(2).OTHERWISE, IF YOU DESIRE TO HAVE THE PAYMENT BY CHECK:

 

Then, you do not have to provide your banking information. Simply provide me =
with:

a) Your full names (As would be on the check).

b) Contact/Mailing address

c) Your Telephone and Fax Number.

 

Furthermore, as surety for the money that would be paid to you on my behalf, =
I would need a scanned copy of your International Passport or Drivers License =
for record purpose.

 

When I receive all the aforementioned, I will then send a working AGREEMENT =
between you and I, to guide and guard this relationship.

 

Once all these are sorted out, I will notify the first company of my desire =
to receive my money through you and instruct them accordingly.

 

In conclusion:

 

I wish to draw your attention to the wise observation of Marlene Gill, who =
wrote:

 

"To exist is to change,

To change is to mature,

To mature is to go on creating one's self endlessly,"

 

As we continue to change and to mature as individuals and as a nation, let us =
continue to dream that one-day, very soon, Cholera and HIV/AIDS will no =
longer devastate our nation, that all of our young people will resort to =
responsible behavior and that the moral values of our forebears will once =
more dominate our society.

 

LET US DARE TO DREAM. For it is not an impossible dream.

 

This is simply from my heart to you.

 

I wish you the very best while giving my thanks in anticipation of a lasting =
business relationship with you.

 

Kindly send the requirements as mentioned above via my private email =
addresses as stated.

 

My regards,

 

K. M. ZONDI (REV),

Deputy Minister of Public Works,

Central Government Building,

6th Floor, Room 623,

Dear Sir, 




I am DR KABO HAMMED




I have urgent and very confidential business
proposition for you. On June 6, 1999, an American oil
consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National
Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered
time (Fixed) deposited for twelve calendar months,
valued at US$41,500,000.00 (Forty-one Million, five
hundred Thousand Dollars) in my branch upon maturity,
I sent a routine notification to his forwarding
address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a
reminder and finally we discovered from his contract 
employers, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation
that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an automobile accident 
with his family along Benin/Shagamu Express Way. On 
further investigation, I found out that he did not 
leave a WILL and allattempts to trace his next of kin 
were fruitless. 




I therefore made further investigation and discovered 
that Mr. Barry Kelly did not declare any next of kin n
all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit
paperwork. This sum of US$41,500,000.00 is still
sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled
over with the principal sum at the end of each year.
No one will come forward to claim it. 
According to the Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5
(five) years, the money will revert to the ownership
of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim
the funds. 




Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry
Kelly so that the fruits of this old man's labor will
not get into the hands of some corrupt officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide me
immediately with your full names and address so that
the attorney will prepare the necessary documents 
and affidavits, which will put you in place as the
next of kin.
 
We shall employ the services of two attorneys for
drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor the transfer. A
bank account in any part of the world, which you
provide, will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the
ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you. 




There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this
transaction will be done by the attorney and my
position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction.
If you are interested, please reply immediately via
email. Upon your response, I shall then provide you
with more details and relevant documents that will
help you Understand. please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest
assured that this transaction would be most profitable
for both of us because I shall require your assistance
to invest my share in your country. 




Awaiting your urgent reply via email:dr_kabortsb@yahoo.com




Thanks and regards
 
DR KABO HAMMED

My Dear Friend,
 
I am Mr.George Akin,from Arab Bank Plc,Benin Rep. During the 
course of our auditing we discovered the sum of (USD$9.7m) 
floating in an account opened in this Bank since 1999 and as 
from 2001 nobody has operated on this account again, and after 
going through some old files in the records I discovered that 
the owner of the account died without a [HEIRE]sept 11th 2001 
by plane crash, hence the money is floating.

After due verification I noticed that no other person knows 
about this account except his wife who was also invovled in the 
crash, and the account has no other beneficiary and my 
investigation proved to me as well that until his death he was 
the Director GOLD ARK [SARL]
 
Since our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got information about 
his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come 
forward and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the 
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and policies 
but up to date nobody came up to this bank as his next of kin 
or relative. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and 
other officials in my department now decided to make this 
businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the 
next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and 
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming forth and we 
don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed 
Bill.
 
On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used 
as the next of kin as no one has come up as his relation. And 
the country law here does not allow such money to stay more 
than Five years, for the money will be recalled to the 
government treasury as unclaimed after this period.
Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the 
application form, bank's contact and the next step to take. I 
will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 
hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all 
modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five 
banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the 
deceased.
 
When you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail 
signifying your decision.Including your private Tel/Fax numbers 
for quick communication. I will be very happy if you can treat 
this business with the utmost secrecy it demands because of my 
position in this bank.

Hoping for a very successful business relationship with you.
Respectfully submitted,

Mr George Akin.

Dear Prospective Partner,
 
Accept my compliments. However strange or surprising this contact might seem =
to you, I ask that you give due consideration to its importance, as we both =
stand to benefit immensely. Though we have not met or know each other, this =
is a criterion I have used to select you, as I wish to cut off all ties with =
my people for security and safety reasons.
 
I am a stepson and personal aide to the Late General Robert Guei of blessed =
memory, former President of Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast).
 
You may not be conversant with the present situation in my country, which has =
gradually degenerated into a civil war. On September 19, 2002, My Dad led a =
failed coup d'etat against President Laurent Gbagbo, in a bid to restore =
political stability in my country. Unfortunately, he was killed. After my =
Dad's death, there was confusion and power struggle in our camp; this led to =
an insurgence of several factions and has left no hope for peace anytime =
nearby.  To understand more on the situation click on this link =
http://www.state.gov/p/af/rls/rm/17657.htm 
 
 I decided to flee my country, as I desired a peaceful life, and I no more =
had interest in conflicts and wars. 
 
To the point, the essence of my contact with you is to seek your most needed =
assistance to siphon US$18,500,000 left in the bunker of my Dad=92s Private =
Palace. Only my Dad and me knew about this fund. Now that my Dad is dead, I =
intend to use this money for my personal benefit (as well as yours if you =
accept to be my partner). I see justification in diverting the money, rather =
using it to support the purchase of weapons for destruction of innocent lives =
and properties.
This money has been moved in cash in a trunk to my present location in Europe =
through diplomatic means. I plan to invest this money in diversified =
projects, and relocate to a private location. As you can understand, the kind =
of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act =
of desperation on my part, in order have my plans achieved in the shortest =
possible time. When the trunk is claimed, we shall firstly have the money =
deposited into an Offshore account in your name, as I am being discrete of =
using my name for now. Then you shall have your own share withdrawn to an =
account of your choice, and leave the rest as fixed deposit, for release to =
me at the appropriate time for the investments and my relocation. 
Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost =
secrecy. Be informed that I am confiding in you by disclosing all this =
information to you, hence it is only me (apparently you now) that have =
knowledge of this. The importance of prosecuting this within the next few =
days cannot be overlooked; hence your immediate response will be highly =
appreciated.
If you accept to assist me, for your reliable assistance, I will reward you =
with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. 
On hearing from you, I shall disclose my location to you, and explain details =
of your role in this. Furthermore, everything regarding this process will be =
legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction =
should be completed in a very short while, depending on your prompt response.=

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve =
this goal. 
Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This =
will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your =
part.
Sincerely,
J.C.G.

: Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha.

I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha, from Kuwait. I am married to 
Usman Isa Kaitha of blessed 
memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine 
years before he died in the year 
2002. We were married for eleven years without a child he died 
after a brief illness that lasted 
only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted Muslim and 
I was a devoted Christian by 
birth battling with both cancer and fibroid problems. When my 
late husband was alive, he 
deposited the sum of $25.5million dollars (twenty five million, 
five hundred dollars), which he in
herited from his late father (sheikh Usman Isa Kaitha) with an 
overseas finance and security firm. 
Presently, this money is still with finance and security firm. 
Recently, my doctor told me that I 
had a terminating illness (cancer) that would last for the next 
four months. 

Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either 
a Christian organization or a 
devoted Christian individual that will utilize this money the way 
I am going to instruct here in.
  

I want this Christian organization or individual to use this 
money in all sincerity to fund 
churches, orphanages, widows and also propagating the word of God 
and to ensure that the society 
upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible 
emphasized so much on the giving 
of alms, charity and this has encouraged me in taking this bold 
step. I took this decision 
because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives 
are all Muslims and I don't want 
my husband&#8217;s hard earned money to be misused by people that call 
me an unbeliever.

I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an 
unholy manner hence the reasons for 
taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with 
God the highest and the most 
merciful one. I don't need any telephone communications but will 
only give you the contact of my 
lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making 
you the beneficiary of the 
consignment in the finance and security firm if you receive this 
letter and accept to assist me 
to conclude this transaction, if you want to speak with me he 
will arrange for that because my 
doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly, I 
can't discuss in the presence of
my husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the 
hospital, my lawyer is the only person 
that knows the decision that I am taking.

With God, I know that all things are possible and as soon as I 
receive your reply through my 
lawyer I will now give him instruction to make you the 
beneficiary of the consignment and all 
necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall 
also give you the contact of the
finance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of 
authority that will prove you as the 
original beneficiary of the funds. I want you and the Christian 
community where you reside to 
always pray for me. 

My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian 
though married to a Muslim, 
whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in 
spirit, please always be prayerful 
all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room 
in souring for another Christian
organization or a devoted Christian for the same purpose. 

Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your 
shoulders, may the Almighty God 
continue to guide and protect you. Amen. 

Yours faithfully, 

PLEASE REPLY THROUGH MY ATTORNEYS PRIVATE EMAIL:kufor100@yahoo.com

{URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL)

(RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 134,000.000.00 USD 
ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS ) 

Dear Sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 134,000.000.00 USD) One
hundred and Thirty four million United States Dollars)
from National Credit Bank (NCB) of South Africa, I want to
ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest person
who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing
bank account or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to
receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve to receive
this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till
the end for this important business trusting in you and
believing in God that you will never let me down either now
or in future.

I am MR. MATTHEW MOLEFE, the Auditor General in Natinal
Credit Bank (NCB) of South Africa, during the course of our
auditing I discovered a floating fund in an account opened
in the bank in 1993 and since 1999 nobody has operated on
this account again, after going through some old files in
the records I discovered that the owner of the account died
without a [heir] hence the money is floating and if I do
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for
nothing. The owner of this account is Mr. Reed H.Huish, a
foreigner, and a sailor, and he died, since 1999. And no
other person knows about this account or any thing
concerning it, the account has no other beneficiary and my
investigation proved to me as well that Reed H.Huish until
his death was the Reed H.Huish Coy.(pty). SA. 

We will start the first transfer with Thirty four million
[$34,000.000.00] upon successful transaction without any
disappoint from your side, we shall re-apply for the
payment of the remaining rest amount of($ 100,000.000.00
USD) to your account.

The amount involved is ($ 134,000.000.00 USD) One hundred
and thirty four million United States Dollars, only I want
to first transfer $34,000.000.00 [thirty four million

Your Ref:

First, I must solicit your strictest confidence in this transaction, this is by virtue of the nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.

I am the Director of project and the newly appointed chairman, contract reviewing committee(CRC) of the Federal ministry of Works and Housing (FMW&H) in Lagos, Nigeria, I am seeking your assistance to enable me transfer the sum of US $17,000,000.00 into your account for mutual benefits. This money came about as a result of a contract executed on behalf of my Ministry, the (Federal Ministry of Works and Housing). This contract was officially assigned to be awarded and executed by two foreign contractors at the tune of US$80,500,000.00, but in the course of my negotiation, I bargained with only one foreign contractor, a Bulgarian firm which now executed the contract at the cost of US $63,500,000.00. Thus leaving the remaining US$17M to my benefits unknown to the contractor and any other person in my Ministry. 

This contract has been satisfactorily executed and inspected as the Bulgarian firm is presently securing his payment from my Ministry. It is however to this effect that I seek your maximum assistance and approval to present your company name alongside with the Bulgarian contractor as the second foreign contractor to enable me transfer the difference(US$17M) into your account for further investment depending on your advice. On actualization of the transaction, the funds will be shared thus:
1. 35% of the money go to you for acting as the beneficiary of the funds. 2. 10% for reimbursement to both parties for incidental expenses that may be incurred in the course of the transaction for Insurance, phone bills, documentation etc 
3. 55% to me. All logistics are in place and all modalities worked out for the smooth actualization of the transaction within fourteen working days of commencement after receiving the following information by fax: Your address,phone and fax numbers.
The above information will enable me make application and lodge claims to concerned Ministries in favour of your company or name and it is pertinent to state here that this deal is entirely based on trust and the fear of God. Dear Sir, if you are able to handle this deal, reach me through my official telephone number 234 2810 8124 for a perfect understanding of this transaction. After the close of work every week days I will parallel this telephone line to my official residence, which is not far from the Federal Secretariat Complex, so that you can reach me at any point in time.

EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
TREASURES DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
 
 HENCE MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA

CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM OF ONE HUNDRED

WITH A SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING.

THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM 
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO 
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY 
RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF.

ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE
YOU TO MY SON (NZANGA) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES

ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT
WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED.

I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK
IN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN
OTHER SAFE AND NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS.
MAY  I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL
OF CONFIDENTIALITY, WHICH THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS,
AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE,
WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU.IN CONCLUSION, IF YOU WANT TO
ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF
THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE

I Need Your Urgent Reply. 
               
             {MONEY  TRANSACTION} 

Dear Sir,Madam
                                         
My name is Mr.Cyril Beko, and I work in the
International operation department in a Local Bank
here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I
discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL.
Of  36,000,000 (Thirty Six Million USD) on further
discreet investigation, I also discovered that the
account holder has long since passed away (dead)
leaving no beneficiary to the account. The bank will
approve this money to any foreigner because the former
operator of the a/c is a foreigner and from Iraq in
particular and I am certainly sure that he is dead,
and nobody will come again for the claim of this money
A foreigner can only claim this money with legal
claims to the account Holder; therefore I need your
cooperation in this transaction. 

I will provide the necessary information needed in
order to claim this money, But you will need to open 
an account where this can be transferred. If
interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax 
number including full details of the account to be
used for the Deposit I wish for utmost confidentiality

in handling this transaction as my job and the future
of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.


I want to assure you that the transaction is without
risk if due process is followed accordingly. Finally, 
I will give you 25% for your corporation. 

I look forward to your earliest reply through this
email or my private
mail:GOD_BEE_WITH_US@YAHOO.CO.UK.You should try to
call me on my satelite phone no.
882-1646685262. 


I look forward to a favorable response from you. 

Yours 

Mr.Cyril.

Mr. James Nicholas
Calabar, 

Dear Prospective Business Partner,

I am e-mailing to you this business proposition having gone through your =
remarkable profile on the internet. Though, this medium (Internet) has been =
greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the =
fastest, surest and most secured means for me to communicate with you at this =
time.

However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be =
treated as such. Official telephone calls and fax messages to me WILL NOT be =
entertained for security reasons and for the success of this project. For =
further briefing, you can reach me only via my private email address as =
stated below or through my lawyer whose contact shall be provided to you
in due cause.

My name is Mr. James Nicholas. I am the chief financial controller to Mr. =
Charles Taylor, the ex-president of Liberia who is presently on exile in =
Nigeria.  As his private financial controller, I have access to his financial =
records more than any of his family members.

Mr Charles Taylor has over $1 billion dollars outside Liberia and his family =
members or people around him are not aware of this. With his present notion =
of arrest and following his restricted movement and the recent proclamation =
by Zurich authority, the U.N war crimes court and the America Government, has =
agreed that all Bank account belonging to Charles Taylor should be reported =
and freezed. 

Therefore I want to use this opportunity to make good money for myself. I =
have worked for him for over 10 years and I have nothing to show for it. I am =
only leaving on his empty promises and hopes.

Presently, I have complete information to authorize with documents for =
collecting /receiving $200 million from one of his financial sources in South =
Africa. And I need your assistance in receiving the funds in Europe on my =
behalf. Charles Taylor has prepared himself legally and secretly arranged =
with Top most Government agents to transfer the funds upon instructions.

In light of the above, I am seeking your cooperation to act as the authorized =
beneficiary of the said funds to enable us claim the funds for our mutual =
benefit. As you probably already aware, Mr. Charles Taylor maybe handed over =
by his host country to the new Liberia Government to face trial soon hence =
the need for urgent attention to this matter. 

Your prompt responce to my proposal will be highly appreciated. As soon as I =
receive your geniue intention to cooperate with me, I will have my lawyer =
provide you with the necessary details as required to enable us conclude this =
transaction successfully. I thank you and look forward to hearing from you =
shortly.

Regards

James Nicholas
please reply via my private e-mail below.
e-mail: jnicholas@zwallet.com 

..........................................

Because of charles Taylors notion of arrest, and with the present development =
the security alert-ness is higher, so I will introduced my lawyer to you upon =
your responce to my proposal.

 Headquarter, 
 First Bank of Nigeria Plc.
 Lagos, Nigeria.
 Phone: 234-80-37142361.
 Alternative Email:judeigbo@juno.com		
 
 Sir,
 
 Compliment of the day and how is life general with
 you? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and
 crave your indulgence to make this project request
 for
 a joint business transaction which I hope will not
 come to you as a surprise, hence I plead for your
 pardon.  
 I am Mike Igbo, the manager of headquarter first
 bank
 of Nig. Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and
 confidential
 business proposal for you. 
 
 On June 6, 1997, an Australian oil
 consultant/contractor with via National Petroleum
 cooperation (NNPC) Mr. Peter Bush made a numbered
 time
 (fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued
 at
 US$25,000, 000. 00(Twenty-Five Million US Dollars)
 in
 my branch.
 
 On maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
 forwarded address but got no reply after months we
 send a reminder and finally we discovered from his
 contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum
 Corporation) that Mr. Peter Bush died from an
 automobile accident. On further investigation, it
 was
 clear that he died without making a will. All
 attempts by the Australian to trace his next of kin
 were fruitless.
 
 I therefore made further investigation and
 discovered
 that Mr. Peter Bush did not declare any next of kin
 or
 relations in all his official documents including
 his
 deposit document in my bank. The total sum
 US$25,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant
 acct.
 No one will ever come forward to claim it. According
 to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money
 will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
 Government. If the account owner is certified death
 and nobody comes forward to claim it.
 
 This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am
 looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the
 beneficiary/next of kin. This is simple. All you
 have
 to do is to immediately send me the details of a
 bank
 account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the
 proper money transfer document. The money will then
 be
 transferred into the account for us to share in the
 ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining
 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with
 here
 and there.
 
 There is no risk involved. I am using my position
 and
 connection in the bank here to do all the document
 work for the transaction. We shall employ the
 services
 of an attorney to draft the will and obtain all
 necessary documents and letter of administration in
 your favor for the transfer. This transaction is
 risk
 free guaranteed. If you are interested, please reply
 immediately confidentiality and be rest assured that
 this transaction could be most profitable for both
 of
 us. Please do not expose this deal if you are not
 interested because if you do, it will take me out of
 seat.
 
 I am awaiting your urgent reply.
 
 Best regards,
 
  Mike Igbo.
